    "Neural networks are a pretty old algorith the tries to rundimentally mimic the brain functioning. They were widely used in the '80s and early '90s but their populariy diminishider in the late '90s. They had a recent resurgence and they are now a state-of-the-art technique for many applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the reason for their resurgence was that, being computationally expensive, only recently computers became fast enough to really use large-scale neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea that inspired neural networks is that our brain can perform many different operations (process images, sound and sense of touch, coordinate movement, perform numerical calculations) with *one learning algorithm* instead that with many dedicated programs."
