PERIODICAL ABSTRACTS 

THE NEW TESTAMENT: GENERAL 


782. P. G. Duncker, “Ricordando il Cardinale Agostino Bea, biblista e ecumenista,” 
Angelicum 59 (1, ’82) 45-58. 

The first part of the article describes A. Bea’s scientific contributions to biblical scholarship 
and his influence in official Roman Catholic circles with respect to biblical matters before and 
during Vatican II. The second part recounts how Bea’s biblical interests led him to intense 
ecumenical activity during and after the Council.—D.J.H. 

783. J. Homerski, “Ekumenismo kaj Biblio” [Ecumenism and Bible], BibRevuo 17 (4, ’81) 
91-101. 

After outlining some important ecumenical developments related to the Bible that have 
occurred over the past twenty years, the article reflects on the possible significance of the Bible 
itself in promoting greater understanding among Christians and'between Christians and mem¬ 
bers of other religious traditions.—D.J.H. 

784. J. L. McKenzie, “Biblical Studies since 1950,’’ Cross Currents [West Nyack, NY] 31 (4, 
’81-’82) 400-406. 

Not until 1950, with the publication of Humani generis, did it become clear what Catholic 
biblical studies were being liberated from. In the ensuing thirty years we discovered more in 
detail what this meant. We have not yet found out what they were liberated for.—D.J.H. 

785. J. SCHLOSSER, “En memoire du professeur Joseph Schmitt (1911-1981),’’ RevSciRel55 (4, 
’81) 221-226. 

A biographical sketch and personal appreciation of the late Professor Schmitt, who taught for 
many years on the Catholic theological faculty at the Universite des Sciences Humaines de 
Strasbourg. A three-page bibliography of his books and articles is included.—D.J.H. 

786. S. Schmidt, “L’impegno ecumenico biblico del Cardinale Bea,’’ Biblica 63 (1, ’82) 1-21. 

The article explores how A. Bea’s biblical studies prepared him for his work in promoting 
ecumenical understanding and church unity. After a biographical introduction, it focuses on 
concrete examples of Bea’s biblical-ecumenical activity. Then it surveys his views on the 
Bible’s place in Christian life, the ecumenical significance of Scripture, the function of tradition 
in interpreting Scripture, inspiration, and the unity of the Bible.—D.J.H. 

787. G. Strecker, “Where are we in New Testament Studies Today?’’ Colloquium 14 (I, ’81) 
14-22. 

Because it is oriented to the historical and to the present, NT study participates both in 
contemporary intellectual and social life and in the life of theology and church. The tendency 
toward specialization is evident in NT textual criticism and the investigation of the NT in the 
context of the history of religions. The ecclesiological-ecumenical responsibility of NT study is 
properly fulfilled when it renders the Christ-event witnessed in Scripture understandable to the 
present. The article concludes with seven theses regarding the most important areas of NT

study today: canon, history of redaction, Galilean and Judean literary blocks in the Synoptic j 
Gospels, the historical Jesus, Paul’s writings, the Johannine literature, and early Christian 
pluralism.—D.J.H. 

788. G. Van Belle, “Bibliographia J. Coppens. Opera et articuli Professoris emeriti 1967- 
1981,” EphTheolLov 57 (4, ’81) 326-340. 

The article lists 229 books and articles by the late Professor Coppens according to their years 
of publication from 1968. [The same issue contains tributes to Coppens by G. Thils (pp. 227- 
232), M. Sabbe (pp. 233-237), and J. Hofkens (pp. 238-240), as well as appraisals of his achieve¬ 
ments as an OT specialist by J. Lust (pp. 241-265), as a sacramental theologian by A. Houssiau 
(pp. 266-269), and as an Erasmus scholar by J. Etienne (pp. 270-273). Also included are four 
articles by F. Neirynck on Coppens’s contributions to the Joume'es Bibliques de Louvain (pp. 
274-292), a controversy regarding A. Van Hoonacker (pp. 293-297), the Royal Belgian Academy 
(pp. 298-308), and EphTheolLov (pp. 309-325).]—D.J.H. 

Interpretation 

789. S. Accame, ”11 problema storiografico e la critica storica,” Teologia 6 (3, ’81) 243-278. 

After describing the origin of historical criticism in ancient Greece, the article discusses the 
significance of documentary evidence and tradition, especially with regard to form criticism and 
redaction criticism. Then it treats the importance of source criticism, the problem of the his¬ 
torian’s personality, historiographical method and the methods of other sciences, histori¬ 
ography and artistic exigency, spurious forms of history, and particular histories and universal 
ethical-political history.—D.J.H. 

790. R. J. Allen, “Feeling and Form in Biblical Interpretation,” Encounter Al) (1, ’82)99-107. 

S. K. Danger’s recognition of the role of human feelings in the formation and interpretation of 
literary texts can illuminate biblical texts in fresh and suggestive ways. The biblical writers 
projected their feelings into the form of texts, and these feelings are evoked in those who hear or 
read the texts today. When we can describe the feelings from within which the biblical stories 
emerged, then perhaps we can identify situations, contexts, and images from our world that 
arouse similar responses.—D.J.H. 

791. D. C. Bass, “Women’s Studies and Biblical Studies: An Historical Perspective,” Joiirn \ 
StudOT 22 {'%!) 6-11. 

In the late 19th century, the rise of higher criticism of the Bible and the feminist movement j 
shared a great deal intellectually but did not coincide socially. Women members of the Society 
of Biblical Literature did not combine their commitment to women’s causes with their scholarly 
activity. Until the 1970s it was necessary to seek elsewhere for feminist hermeneutics.—D.J.H. 

792. P. J. Cahill, “Hermeneutical Implications of Typology,” CathBihQuart 44 (2, ’82) 266- 
281. 

The speech of Stephen in Acts 7:2-60, the large and small typological structures in the NT, the 
typological structure of the Synoptic tradition, the iconographic evidence of typological profu¬ 
sion, and the example of Joachim of Fiore and of the Reformers who implemented his spiritual 
vision all indicate the inherent power of a hermeneutical procedure that takes the word of God 
seriously. The hermeneutical implications of typology are ultimately identified with word and

In the last decade there has been a paradigm shift in biblical studies from “history” to 
“story.” In light of the negative results of historical research, the biblical accounts have 
emerged as predominantly fictions that may incorporate some historical data. The power of 
these stories comes from our ability to identify with them and feel that they are true for 
us.—D.J.H. 

794. J. R. Donahue, “Scripture: A Roman Catholic Perspective,” RevExp 79 (2, ’82) 231-244. 

Vatican II’s Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation {Dei verbiim) provides the most 
official locus for understanding the authority of Scripture in Catholicism. Four aspects of the 
document are considered here: the understanding of revelation; the relation between Scripture 
and tradition; inspiration, inerrancy, and the proper interpretation of Scripture; and Scripture in 
the life of the church. [The same issue contains W. L. Hendricks’s article (pp. 245-257) about the 
place of the Bible in Southern Baptist churches and an epilogue (p. 258) by Donahue and 
Hendricks, as well as F. Stagg’s article (pp. 381-395) on eschatology [§ 26-693].]—D.J.H.

87-94. 

Literary criticism in biblical study becomes problematic when it calls for an aesthetic appre¬ 
ciation of texts apart from historical and theological questions. Structural analysis is vulnerable 
because of its ahistorical, formalistic, and universalizing tendencies. The interpretation of 
Scripture in a theological context is an act of remembrance (anamnesis), critical “distantia- 
tion,” and re-presentation in a new context.—D.J.H.

This analysis of how knowledge about the Bible is transmitted in France through the print 

medium first evaluates the publications of the Catholic “Service Biblique Evangile et Vie” and 
the Protestant “Equipes de Recherche Biblique.” The second part reviews magazines 
(Aujourd’hui la Bible, Jesus, Le monde de la Bible) intended for “consumers of culture,” and 
the third part focuses on the official hierarchical Pierres vivantes. Many of these publications 
are written by clerical exegetes concerned primarily with the past, and Pierres vivantes tends to 
subordinate and reduce the Bible to the institutional church.—D.J.H.

and the biblical critic’s understanding. Recent hermeneutical tendencies toward viewing Scrip¬ 
ture as story—as a perpetually “open” text—are worth encouraging; they allow the biblical 
scholar to continue refining a historical understanding of Jesus, while freeing the Jesus-story to 
enter the domain of literary discourse.—D.J.H. 

799. F. C. Rossow, “Dramatic Irony in the Bible—With a Difference,” ConcJourn 8 (2, ’82) 
48-52. 

In secular literature dramatic irony is usually grim, painful, and shattering. But biblical irony 
almost always highlights God’s grace and goodness. If there is a surprise, it is a pleasant one. 
Irony in the Bible accents blessing rather than tragedy, and gospel rather than law.—D.J.H. 

800. S. M. Schneiders, “The Paschal Imagination: Objectivity and Subjectivity in New Testa¬ 
ment Interpretation,” TheolStud 43 (1, ’82) 52-68. 

An adequate hermeneutical theory would make it clear that there are three fatally mistaken 
approaches to the NT text: (1) separating sense from reference and dealing only with sense, i.e. 
what the text says; (2) attending separately or exclusively to the historical reference; and 
(3) attending separately or exclusively to the existential reference. The most promising and 
valid approach to interpreting the NT is a dialectical one in which the interpreter moves, 
through ever-fmer mediations, between the pole of explanation by means of literary and his¬ 
torical-critical exegesis and the pole of understanding by means of theological-spiritual sensi¬ 
tivity. The paschal imagination guides this dialectic toward a hermeneutical objectivity that is 
the transformation of the interpreter by the coming-to-event of the text as word of 
God.—D.J.H.

JournStudOT 22 (’82) 32-46. 

Feminist theology as a critical theology of liberation shares the impulses of historical-critical 
scholarship and the theological goals of liberation theology. It offers important challenges on 
several fronts; scholarly preunderstandings and frameworks, androcentric texts and transla¬ 
tions, androcentric sources and traditions, patriarchal canonization and censure, and scriptural 
authority and hermeneutics. The effect of women’s studies on biblical studies will depend on 
whether women scholars can reclaim early Christian theology and history as “their own 
affair.”—D.J.H.

The article answers three questions frequently posed to those who use psychological models 
in interpreting biblical texts: What is wrong with the old ways? How can psychology add to our 
insights? Why are some people so resistant to such attempts? Psychological language aims at 
revealing the depths of human transformation. Since this is also the goal of theological language, 
there is no reason why the two cannot walk together in the search for truth.—D.J.H.

dualism of the finite and the infinite, the relative and the absolute, which makes acceptance of

Rom 16:25-27. Then it clarifies the role of computers in the process of manuscript collation, and 
observes that the designation ‘‘standard text” came from periodicals and newspapers rather 
than from the editors. Attention is also given to the critical comments of G. D. Kilpatrick.—

The aims of capturing the market and creating a monopoly seem to have gotten mixed up with 
the publication of Novum Testamentum graece (26th ed., 1979). The claim of finality attached 
to it implies that all NT textual work is done and that we no longer need to give thought to the text 
we use and translate. The dangerous label ‘‘standard text” should be dropped, and the new 
edition recognized for what it is—a good milestone.—D.J.H.

[ K. Aland and his team deserve commendation for completing the new edition of the Greek 
\ NT, the Computerkonkordanz and the Vollstdndige Konkordanz, and the volume devoted to 

[ word statistics. But critical questions remain concerning both the scientific and the publishing 

i sides of these undertakings. The first article inquires into how new the 26th edition of Novum 

\ Testamentum graece is compared with the previous editions of the Nestle text. It also queries 

I the relation between the two concordances and the use of the words ‘‘computer” and ‘‘com- 

' plete” in their titles. The second article disputes Aland’s claims about the superior accuracy 

and utility of the volume on word statistics compared with Morgenthaler’s Statistik des neutes-

The text-critical principle of preferring the ‘‘harder reading” does not mean that we have to 
accept every scribal blunder that makes nonsense of the text. This point is illustrated by 
discussions of Lk 14:5; Mk 1:2; and Mk 6:22.—D.J.H.

(1) In the NT, no semantic distinction is observed between hos and hostis. (2) The mixed 
declension {hos-hetis-ho, etc.) is valid for all the NT authors, with the remarkable exceptions of 
Matthew’s use of hostis, Luke’s he and hoi-hai, and Paul’s nominative hatina. (3) The use of 
hosos is reduced in the singular to the accusative, except in Hebrews. In the plural, it appears in 
all the cases but the dative. Hosoi and hosa are frequently preceded by pantes and panta 
according to their quantitative value in the Gospels and Acts. (4) The intensive hosper does not 
appear, but on four occasions it occurs as a variant of the simple relative.—D.J.H.

The neologism akrobystia appeared first in the Septuagint and the NT. Modeled on the Greek

The arguments offered in support of the dynamic-equivalence principle constitute a strong 
case for the superiority of such translations over formal-equivalence or literal ones. These 
arguments are based on the differences in languages (grammatical, structural, lexical), the need 
to make implicit information explicit in translation, and the problem of culturally bound 
terms.—D.J.H.

In X. Leon-Dufour (ed.), I miracoli di Gesu secondo il Nuovd Testamento (1980), the editor 
and others maintain that the concept of miracles as exceptions to the laws of nature makes God 
contradict himself, is prescientific, and is contrary to the biblical (and Augustinian) view 
according to which creation, with its ordinary and extraordinary happenings, is one continuous 
miracle. However, God does not contradict himself in establishing general laws of nature with 
rare exceptions (when he intervenes to show special love toward human beings). This concept 
best agrees with unbiased, modem scientific thought. Other topics treated in the article are 
verifying miracles, excluding other explanations, and the existence of present-day miracles.—

817. K. Hruby, “La Tradition rabbinique comme terrain d’eclosion de la Predication evange-

The various tendencies and movements in Judaism during the Second Temple period (inter¬ 
pretation of the written and oral Torahs, transcendent eschatology, messianic effervescence) 
constituted the spiritual and cultural background of the Gospels and their message. The correct 
understanding of Jesus’ preaching of the kingdom of God and his messiahship is impossible 
without an appreciation of their roots in contemporary Judaism.—D.J.H.

The article gives an account of the form-critical school, as represented by R. Bultmann, and 
of how it built on the foundations laid by earlier scholars (e.g. B. Bauer, W. Wrede, and J. 
Wellhausen). The development and growth of form criticism are surveyed with reference to the 
nature of the Gospels as primarily products of the church’s faith, Jesus’ messianic self-con¬ 
sciousness, and the relation between the historical Jesus and the Jesus of faith.—J.S.H.

The Gospel parables are teachings of Jesus addressed to his disciples and the crowd that are 
conveyed through images and open up a heavenly perspective. Besides the many obvious 
parables in the Synoptic Gospels, there are also “hidden” parables in the Sermon on the Mount

(Mt 5:13, 14-16; 6:19-21, 22-23, 24, etc.) and the Fourth Gospel (Jn 2:19; 3:8, 14-15, 29; 4:7-15, 
etc.). The focus of the parables in the Synoptic Gospels is the mystery of the kingdom; in Jn it is 
the mystery of Jesus, especially'the paschal mystery.—D.J.H. 

820. A. C. Wire, “The Miracle Story as the Whole Story,” SEAsiaJournTheol 22 (2, ’81) 
29-37. 

Jesus’ actantial role in the Gospel miracle stories is highly ambiguous. He operates reactively 
to cut off those who impose their will on others, to guide those who have to provide for others, 
and to cede healing to those who know the will to claim it. The four major types of miracle 
stories draw their language along different axes: exorcisms (convulsing over against rebuking), 
controversies (holding over against releasing), provisions (empty over against overflowing), and 
healings (partial and apart over against whole). The ruling contrary pair in the semantic struc¬ 
ture of all the stories appears to be subhuman over against human. The essential factor is an 
alignment of the hearers with the story’s basic angle of vision, in this case one that looks from 
the actual subhuman condition to the impossible human condition.—D.J.H.

That Jesus was a revolutionary stirring up the people against their Roman rulers was the 
thesis of R. Eisler and S. G. F. Brandon. Drawing copiously from G. Jossa, Gesu e i movimenti 
di liberazione della Palestina (1980), the article shows that their thesis lacked a solid founda¬ 
tion. In the 1st century, the Zealots and the Sicarii were fighting to drive out the Romans. But 
Jesus did not belong to either group, nor did he imitate these movements. For example, the 
cleansing of the Temple was not the act of a Zealot, because Jesus and the disciples left the city 
that night (Mk 11:19). When asked about paying tribute to Caesar, Jesus did not forbid it but 
bade the questioners to think of the things of God (Mk 12:13-17). Although Jesus said that he 
came to bring not peace but a sword (Mt 10:34-36), his saying referred to the sacrifices that must 
be made for faith. In all instances Jesus proved himself a religious leader, not a political 
revolutionary. His enemies brought this false accusation against him (Lk 23:2) so that the 
Romans would get rid of him.—J.J.C. 

822. D. C. Doling, “The Kingdom of God in the Teaching of Jesus,” WordWorld 2 (2, ’82)

The history of the interpretation of Jesus’ teaching on the kingdom of God is traced through 
five stages: the kingdom coordinated with the church, as present in the individual and in 
progressively redeemed society, a future apocalyptic hope, responses to the apocalyptic inter¬ 
pretation, and some recent developments.—D.J.H.

Study,” JournAniAcadRel 49 (4, ’81) 567-588. 

Through the use of modem social-scientific studies on possession and exorcism, it is possible 
to solve the problem of Jesus’ conflict with the public authorities over his exorcising activities. 
Demon possession and exorcism were integral parts of the social structure, and manifested in 
important ways its dominant value of social stability. When Jesus disrupted this structure by 


236

countering it in his exorcisms with his own dominant value of social healing, conflict with the 
public authorities was inevitable. Through his exorcising activity, Jesus became a militant 
exorcist or, in OT terms, an activist prophetic disturber of the peace.—D.J.H.

(1) Literary and historical analysis shows that the condemnation and execution of Jesus were 
juridically the work of Pilate, and thus had a political dimension. Jesus the prophet rejected 
political messianism and relativized political power by subordinating it to the service of God. 
(2) There is no historical evidence for the existence of an armed Jewish resistance movement 
between A.D. 6 and the Jewish Revolt. Jesus’ attitude toward Roman political power had 
nothing to do with the Zealots or the Sicarii. (3) Jesus challenged the social, religious, and 
political assumptions of his society by questioning the scribes and Pharisees’ understanding of 
the Law, by proclaiming the end of the priests’ power and a new temple open to Gentiles, by 
rejecting the rules of separation so dear to the Pharisees, and by assembling the community of 
his disciples.—D.J.H.

death, with the assumptions of Enoch and Elijah, and with the traditions in Sirach and in Jewish 
midrash. The narrative structure of the OT accounts reflects basic biblical ideas; it is repeated in 
the NT stories of Jairus’ daughter and Lazarus, and has resonances in the Gospel accounts of 
Jesus’ death, burial, and resurrection. The Galilean appearances of the risen Lord emphasize 
the messianic kingdom, whereas the Jerusalem appearances stress the mystery of the resurrec¬ 
tion and the life of salvation.—D.J.H. 

829. J. Dore, “Croire en la resurrection de Je'sus-Christ,” Etudes 356 (4, ’82) 525-542. 

Four modem positions regarding Jesus’ resurrection can be distinguished: Jesus’ body was 
taken into heaven; his life continued after his conquest of death; his cause or spirit was carried 
on by his followers; and the event was a purely symbolic expression of a profound human tmth. 
Behind these positions lies either an objectivist or a subjectivist mental attitude. But the NT 
writings imply no opposition between the fact that the resurrection really concerned Jesus of 
Nazareth and the fact that those who affirmed his resurrection were existentially and radically 
involved in it. [A Spanish version of this article appears in RazFe 205 (1007, ’82) 366-378.]—

(2, ’82) 177-183. 

In creating the story of Jesus’ resurrection, the NT writers (or the originators of the oral 
tradition) were elaborating a transformational myth. Their narration of the story justified their 
confidence that ultimate reality is of such a nature as to make possible the transformation of 
persons. Even when the historicity of the narrative is called into question, it can continue to 
function mythologically as an insight into the nature of reality and as a norm for life.—D.J.H.

motif, and considers their terminology and significance. Then it examines Mk 16:1-8 from 
various critical perspectives and reflects on its particular theological significance. In the NT, 
the empty tomb is viewed as a consequence of Jesus’ resurrection rather than a proof of 
it.—D.J.H.

alleged argument for Markan priority based on the order of verbal components will turn out 
either not to be an argument for Markan priority at all, or to be an argument that is actually 
based on considerations other than the mere order of verbal components. Examples of both 
kinds of these pseudoarguments can be found in G. D. Fee’s recent text-critical look at the 
Synoptic problem [§ 24-768].—D.J.H. 

835. P. Parker, “A Second Look at The Gospel Before Mark," JournBibLit 100 (3, ’81) 
389-413. 

The central thesis of Parker’s The Gospel Before Mark (1953) was that our Mt did not derive 
from our Mk, but rather both canonical Gospels came from a common Grundschrift labeled 
“K.” The revisions suggested in this article do not alter Parker’s thesis. The K-hypothesis 
explains the peculiarities of Matthean vocabulary and style, corresponds to clear features of 
both Matthean and Markan structure, accounts for the content and redactional history of the 
two Gospels, shows how inevitable it was that the first Gospel should be named for Matthew, 
fits what the early Fathers said about Mt, and untangles intricate passages in Mt.—D.J.H. 

836. J. J. Schmitt, “In Search of the Origin of the Siglum Q,’’ JournBibLit 100 (4, ’81) 609-611. 

It seems unlikely that J. Wellhausen’s use of the abbreviation “Q” [see § 24-73] in OT study 
influenced J. Weiss to use that siglum in NT study as a logogram. The word Quelle had been 
used in NT scholarship some fifty years before Wellhausen used Q as an abbreviation for Latin 
quattuor {"four") in referring to the “four covenant’’ source. When Wellhausen abandoned this 
abbreviation in favor of “P,” the young theologians at Gottingen took up Q with enthusiasm as 
a German abbreviation in NT study.—D.J.H.

The story of how the Magi found the infant Jesus in Mt 2:1-12 is constructed on a triadic 
pattern with regard to places (in the East, at Jerusalem, on the road to Bethlehem), ways of 
knowing (seeing the star in the East, hearing the prophecy, following the guiding star), and the 
knowledge acquired (the time of coming to adore, the place to which they are directed, the place 
where they adore). The principal performance of the Magi in 2:11-12 consists of three actions 
and involves three gifts. The entire Matthean infancy narrative is organized in similar interlock¬ 
ing triads.—D.J.H.

Contrary to the opinion of J. D. Quinn [§ 26-83], probability favors the identification of 
Rachab in Mt 1:5 as the harlot of Jericho. The form Rachab is consistent with the fact that the 
list of known biblical names in Mt 1:1-17 varies several times from the conventional Greek 
forms. Furthermore, every other name in the first two sections of Matthew’s genealogy is the 
name of an identifiable figure in the Greek Bible, even if it is spelled in a peculiar way.—D.J.H.

In the Bible, peace is a code word for the blessings awaited in the final fulfillment of the 
messianic age. It comports both a vertical dimension of peace between God and humanity and a 
horizontal dimension of peace between persons. Christ is the author of peace, and those who 
follow his rule as peacemakers are deservedly called children of God.—D.J.H.

In Mt 5:31-32 second marriage is used as an example of adultery, which is condemned in 
Mt 5:27-30. The exception introduced by Matthew with the phrase parektos logou porneias in 
V. 32a (see 19:9) concerned the illegitimate unions proscribed by Lev 18:7-17 that had been 
entered into before conversion to Christianity. The exception does not call into question Jesus’

Sermon on the Mount, and Lk 11:2-4 reports a later teaching during the journey from Galilee to 
Jerusalem. (2) There is no reason to abandon the long text of the Lukan version in favor of the 
short version, which is later, less well attested, and suspect on account of the parallels with 
Marcion’s text. (3) Because of its presence in part of the Vetus Latina tradition, the doxology

843. [Mt 6:9-13] W. O. Walker, “The Lord’s Prayer in Matthew and in John,” NTStud 28 (2,

The content, language, and structure of the “high priestly” prayer in Jn 17:1-26 is best 
understood as a reworking and expansion of the Matthean version of the Lord’s Prayer 
(Mt 6:9-13) in terms of specifically Johannine theology. Every element in the Matthean version 
receives some sort of treatment in Jn 17:1-26, and every element in Jn 17:1-26 can be regarded 
as based upon or related to something in Mt 6:9-13. Jn 17:1-8 is a midrashic expansion of the 
three “thou” petitions; 17:9-19 relates primarily to the three “we” petitions; and 17:20-26, 
which recapitulates themes developed earlier in the prayer, includes elements from both the 
“thou” and the “we” petitions.—D.J.H.

The inclusion formed by pephortismenoi and phortion marks the outer boundaries of 
Mt 11:28-30. When the order of 11:29a and 11:29b is reversed, the following structure appears: 
(A) 28a, (B) 28b, (C) 29b; (A') 29a, (B') 29c, (C') 30. This hypothesis about the original form of 
the logion is confirmed by its grammatical structure, logical progression, parallels in Sirach and 
the NT, and content.—D.J.H.

The appeal to the present indicative moichatai in Mt 19:9 in order to establish continuity 
(“continues to commit adultery”) is based on an imprecise understanding of Greek mood

be taken as a gnomic present in which continuity is not under consideration.—D.J.H.

The primitive tradition of the dialogue between Jesus and the rich young man is found in 
Mk 10:17-18, in Lk 18:18-19, and in the Byzantine text of Mt 19:16-17. The secondary tradition 
IS found in a variety of early texts of Mt 19:16-17. Five considerations weigh against the view 
that Matthew was responsible for the secondary version: the precarious basis of the critical text 
at this point, the case for both agathe and agathon in the original text of Mt, the lack of solidity 
in the secondary tradition, the weakness of the simultaneous witness to the critical text in 
address and reply, and the overrating of harmonization as a force for textual change. If either 
the Griesbach or the Augustinian view of Synoptic Gospel relationships could be established 
beyond doubt, the primitive form would be the only reasonable option in Mt 19:16-17. But even

The original reference of the parable of the vineyard and the wicked husbandmen (Mt 21:33- 
46; Mk 12:1-12; Lk 20:9-19) was to John the Baptist. In Lk 20:1-8 this connection leaps to the 
eye. In Mt the parable belongs to what was once a sequence of stories and sayings about John 
the Baptist (see Mt 21:12-22:14). This “Baptist sequence” derived from a common source 
anterior to all the Synoptic Gospels in their received form; the source may have been “proto- 
Matthew.”—D.J.H.

context of Jesus’ saying was simple hygiene rather than ritual purity, and he was speaking 
metaphorically. Furthermore, the purity law that Neusner tries to relate to Jesus’ saying was of 
a highly technical and limited character. Also, the distinction between the inside and the outside 
of a cup in purity law was certainly later than the time of Jesus.—D.J.H.

Rather than presenting Peter as a mere symbol or type, Mark has allowed us to recognize 
some contours of the historical Peter. His portrait agrees with Paul’s presentation of Peter in 
several respects: historical figure, preeminent among the apostles, witness of the risen Lord, 
transmitter of the Jesus-tradition, missionary, and vacillating in character. Mark added the idea 
of Peter as confessor of Jesus’ messiahship (see 8:29) to the tradition.—D.J.H.

Kermode’s work as a whole could be called a “Hermes theology” after the patron of interpreta¬ 
tion. But the question is. Is Hermes the hierophant, or is Christ? Kermode’s approach to Mk 
professes to be secular, so the problems of theology are left out altogether. The narrative of Mk 
is viewed as nothing but fiction consisting of interpretations of interpretations caused by the

down simply to acceptance of the principles of anyone who examines the Bible without believ¬

An adequate assessment of the role of Jesus’ disciples in Mk requires an analytic model that 
takes account of the various narrative levels: the world of the figures in the narrative and their 
interaction, the fictitious narrator and addressee, the abstract author and addressee, the real 
author and addressee, and the historical author and reader. In light of such an analytic model, 
the interpretation of Mark’s presentation of the disciples as polemical can be safely excluded. 
Since Mark wished to tell about the past and had access to traditions reaching back to Jesus, the 
historical explanation has some validity. But the paraenetic interpretation (i.e. the disciples 
exemplify life in the church) must also be taken very seriously.—D.J.H.

Historical concerns about the composition of Mk seem to have motivated E. Lohmeyer, 
R. H. Lightfoot, W. Marxsen, and W. Kelber in their approaches to the narrative opposition 
between Galilee and Jerusalem. The task undertaken here, however, is to consider Markan 
geopolitical locations (especially Galilee and Jerusalem) in their system of relations and to 
investigate the significance of this manifest narrative system in terms of an underlying, non¬ 
manifest mythological system. A diachronic reading of Mk brings out narrative patterns of 
foreshadowing and echoing, while synchronic analysis reveals the fundamental opposition 
between order and chaos. Galilee appears as the center of order; chaos breaks loose when Jesus 
arrives in Jerusalem.—D.J.H.

small group of men, with women usually encountered in private. Then women suddenly become 
prominent in the accounts of Jesus’ death and burial (Mk 15:40-41, 47) and the empty tomb 
(Mk 16:1-8). The only feasible explanation is that the tradition to which Mark had access 
concerned women who were associated with Jesus during his lifetime. The Markan evidence

Mark wrote and arranged his story of Jesus with a soteriological purpose, portraying Jesus as 
a prototype of the beleaguered Christians in the Evangelist’s community. Jesus endured pre¬ 
cisely what the community was experiencing. He not only lived like them; he also lived and died 
for them. Mark sought to proclaim how Jesus’ death saves those who have been baptized in his 
name and who are giving their lives, even as Jesus did, for the sake of that baptismal identity.—

Mk 1:14-20 is a three-step rhetorical unit [see § 25-872] that calls forth the essential dynamics 
of the itinerant preacher-teacher in Mediterranean culture: Jesus the traveling prophet-teacher 
announces the kingdom of God and commands people to respond to his teaching through 
repentance and belief (vv. 14-15); Jesus encounters two men with a command and a promise 
that defines the end result of discipleship in terms of being fishers of men (vv. 16-18); and Jesus 
immediately calls two more men who leave boat, nets, father, and hired servants to go away 
with him (vv. 19-20). While this three-step procedure has its closest parallel in Xenophon’s 
Memorabilia 4.1.5-2.39, the individual parts of the unit intermingle themes, conventions, and 
traditions in a manner characteristic of much literature written during the Hellenistic period. 
Jesus’ role in the narrative resulted from the merging of Jewish prophetic-apocalyptic traditions 
and Greco-Roman teacher-disciple traditions.—D.J.H.

A rapid survey of the history of interpretation of Mk 1:40-45 prepares the way for a syn¬ 
chronic reading of the text in its articulation and context, before the diachronic question of its 
prehistory is dealt with. The many themes present in tension in the pericope—Jesus’ desire to 
remain hidden and his inability to do so (v. 45), the command to silence and its violation 
(vv. 44a, 45a), Jesus’ withdrawing from the crowd and being followed by the crowd (vv. 45b, 
45c)—are further elucidated diachronically through a series of repeated readings and successive 
elaborations of the episode. Analysis of the account and of its Markan redaction raises the 
question of historicity by asking whether it is possible to go beyond the oldest nucleus of the 
narrative. Here the episode proves refractory both to a purely historical approach and to a 
purely form-critical and redaction-critical one. The process of successive readings and elabora¬ 
tions, which made explicit the meaning of Jesus’ original action, was at work from the very 
beginning of the transmission of the episode.

analysis, as practiced by A. J. Greimas, views the text as a syntagmatic manifestation of a 
paradigmatic semantic system of signs that is synchronic. There are three stages of narrative 
transformation: the contract between the characters, the performance of the act, and the sanc¬ 
tion of the act. Structuralist analysis shows that Mk 2:5b-10 is determined as the acceptance of 
the proposal of a healing contract and as the pragmatic veridiction of Jesus’ right to his power of 
forgiving sins. Elimination of these verses is unnecessary and overlooks their double determina¬ 
tion.—D.J.H.

The sayings about the authority of the Son of Man to forgive sins (Mk 2:10) and to be lord of 
the Sabbath (Mk 2:28) acted as pointers to the future suffering of Jesus. The one who had 
authority was the one who was to suffer because his authority was rejected. Likewise, most of 
the “present” Son of Man sayings in Q (e.g. Mt ll:19/Lk 7:34; Mt 8:20/Lk 9:58; Mt 12:32/ 
Lk 12:10; Lk 6:22/Mt 5:11) were not so much about the present authority of Jesus as about his 
rejection and suffering.—D.J.H.

Isa 6:9-10 with its element of prophetic judgment is one of the harshest texts in the prophetic

sophistication rather than naivete or clumsiness. Just as Isaiah spoke Yahweh’s word of judg¬

Jesus’ word (i.e. his “parables”) promoted obduracy.—D.J.H.

Analysis of the accounts of the miracle of the bread in Mk 6:30-44 and 8:1-10 from the 
viewpoints of vocabulary, style, theme, form, and tradition history reveals that the two 
accounts derived from one tradition, the second account being closer to the original form of the 
tradition than the first. Through analysis of the two accounts, it is possible to disengage the 
traditional elements and reconstruct the original tradition: Jesus, a great number of people, and 
the disciples were in a desert place; they had several loaves and a few fish; he divided the loaves 
and fish; the people ate and were satisfied. In the Markan redaction, the miracle of the bread 
had catechesis as its primary purpose. This catechesis included salvation history, Christology, 
missiology, and sacramental theology.—D.J.H.

The absence of gar and the use of an introductory formula (“and he said to them’’) so 
separate Mk 9:1 from 8:38 that one must search for another verse to which it can relate. Mk 9:1

Even if the agreements of Mt 18:1-6 and Lk 9:46-50 against Mk 9:33-42 do not prove a literary 
relationship between Mt and Lk, they at least indicate the presence of non-Markan traditions at

marriages. These NT texts and several Jewish texts collected by E. Bammel [see § 15-528] 
indicate that Jewish women could and did initiate and carry out divorce proceedings. The NT 
passages that do not recognize a woman’s right to divorce her husband represent another legal 
current found also in the rabbinic writings. We do not know exactly why Jesus forbade divorce. 
The explanation that he did so in order to elevate the status of women is open to serious 
objections.—D.J.H.

In the question “How do the scribes say the messiah is David’s son?’’ (Mk 12:35; Mt 22:42; 
Lk 20:41), Jesus challenged a specifically scribal messianic expectation and refused to associate 
himself with it. On the other hand, he embraced the characterization “David’s son,’’ with its 
overtones of Solomonic wisdom and especially of exorcistic and therapeutic skill. The question 
itself represented Jesus’ attempt to evade the charge that he had messianic pretensions. But his 
reputation as “David’s son’’ and his activity in the Temple made it impossible for him to 
forestall for long the coalition of opponents who believed that he did have such pretensions and 
that they were dangerous.—D.J.H.

The warning about the scribes in Mk 12:37b-40 contains the key to Mark’s understanding of 
them as the opposite of what Jesus was and his disciples should be. Jesus warns the crowd 
(vv. 37b-38a) against the scribes’ longing for honor and prestige expressed by their walking

Mt 23:6-7a/Lk 11:43). He also accuses the scribes of draining the resources of widows to pay for 
the Temple costs (v. 40).—D.J.H.

Context,’’ CathBibQuart 44 (2, ’82) 256-265. 

The only way out of the difficulties encountered in interpreting Mk 12:41-44 (see Lk 21:1-4) is 
to view Jesus’ attitude toward the widow’s gift as disapproval of the value system motivating 
her action and not as approbation. The story of the widow’s mite does not provide a pious 
contrast to the conduct of the scribes in Mk 12:38-40 (see Lk 20:46-47). Rather, it further 
illustrates the ills of official devotion. Jesus’ comment on the widow’s action in Mk 12:43-44 
should be taken as a lament.—D.J.H. 

871. [Mk 14—16] J. Riches, “The Dense and Driven Passion—The Story according to Mark,’’ 
Furrow 33 (4, ’82) 195-202. 

Mark’s passion narrative enfolds a double drama. It is the story of Jesus’ overcoming the 
enmity and betrayal of his friends and people, a story that admittedly allows us to see only the 
distant glimmerings of conversion rather than the full reversal of human weakness and de¬ 
pravity. It is also the story' of an agony, of a terrible struggle between Jesus and his Father for 
understanding won in obedience to an apparently implacable and terrible will, which neverthe¬ 
less underlies Jesus’ struggle for the hearts and minds of men and women.—D.J.H. 

872. [Mk 14:22] X. Leon-Dufour, “‘Prenez! Ceci est mon corps,”’ NouvRevTheol 104 (2,

Investigation of Jesus’ word over the bread in both its Markan (Mk 14:22; Mt 26:26) and 
Antiochean (Lk 22:19; 1 Cor 11:24) forms indicates that Jesus’ language was “performative.’’ It 
was addressed to the disciples not to propose a definition of the bread but rather to invite them 
to recognize in the shared bread Jesus’ own body and to constitute the community that would be 
called the church. By his action in sharing the bread and by his interpretative word, Jesus 
established a line of identification between the bread and his body that made him present to his 
disciples and to the world.—D.J.H.

Finding J. B. Bauer’s note [§ 25-410] incomplete, this article offers philological and theolog¬ 
ical reasons for retaining the translation “for many’’ in Mk 14:24 and Mt 26:28. That Hebrew 
and Aramaic had a word for “all” is clear from Isa 53:6 and other texts. That rabbfm can mean 
“many” is evident from Isa 52:14, 15; 53:11, 12. Theologically, rabbim seems to have been a 
term used in salvation history to denote the Gentiles, whom the Servant will include in the new 
covenant. Hence in Mk 14:24 and Mt 26:28, the word “many” signifies that in addition to Israel 
the new covenant embraces the new people of the Gentiles. Consequently, the translation “for 
many” should be retained.—J.J.C.

‘fiir die Vielen’ oder ‘fiir alle’?” BibLiturg 54 (4, ’81) 228-230. 

The data provided by J. B. Bauer [§ 25-410] and C. Schedl [§ 26-873] on Mk 14:24 need to be 
supplemented. The Hebrew concordance shows that kdl can mean “all” when used with a 
plural noun or with personal suffixes (“all of us,” etc.). Furthermore, F. Delitzsch in his 
Hebrew version of the NT reads rabbim in Mk 14:24, but adds that the word could be kdl. 
Whereas Schedl suggests that the rabbim are the “new people,” i.e. the Gentiles called to the 
faith, the same term stands for the Qumran community in IQS 6-7. The decision whether 
Mk 14:24 should be translated with “for many” or “for all” ultimately depends not on phil¬ 
ology, but on the theology underlying the verse.—J.J.C.

Assuming that Jesus spoke Aramaic, we can construe his words in Mk 15:33 (see Mt 27:46) as 
the rhetorical question ’eldhi ’eldhi Idmmdh iabbahtdni (“My God, my God, why have you 
praised me?”), which was transliterated into Greek in exactly the same way as the Aramaic 
rendering of Ps 22:1. This reading, which understands Jesus’ words as a prayer for the dawning 
of God’s reign, meets some of the textual, historical, and theological difficulties connected with 
these troubling verses.—D.J.H.

The story of Mary Magdalene and the other women who witnessed the death and burial of 
Jesus and then visited the tomb (Mk 15:40-16:8) is the earliest NT text known to us about 
women among the disciples of Jesus. The article examines what is said about these women in 
Mk 15:40-41, 47; 16:1-8, and compares the Markan account with Mt 27:55-28:20. Since neither 
Mark nor Matthew showed any interest in the women disciples, they were probably transmit¬ 
ting a traditional report based on the historical situation at the time of Jesus’ death. Their lack of 
theoretical reflection on the role of women in the Christian community had negative conse¬ 
quences for women in the church over the centuries.—D.J.H.

Within the framework of his narrative theology, Luke refined and tightened the relationship 
between the Holy Spirit and Jesus, thus uniting in his own way pneumatology and Christology. 
He interpreted the communication of the Holy Spirit to the eschatological people as the source 
of witness, with a view to giving the church its universal dimension. Proceeding from the 
primitive antithesis between the baptism of water given by John and the baptism of the Spirit 
given by the Messiah, he explained the connection between the baptism of water practiced in 
Jesus’ name and the communication of the Spirit. He presented the Holy Spirit primarily as a 
Spirit of prophecy and witness, one who speaks or makes others speak. The final part of the 
article discusses the OT roots of Luke’s understanding of the Spirit and his concern to establish 
continuity between Israel and the Gentile-Christian church.—D.J.H.

Peter’s characterization of Jesus’ life as “the good news of peace” (see Acts 10:36) is a prism 
through which we can view Luke’s Gospel. With Jesus comes “peace on earth,” which is 
salvation, well-being, and harmony between God and those on whom his favor rests. Jesus 
guides his followers into the way of peace and teaches them the things of peace. The word when 
proclaimed is a word of peace. Whatever the hermeneutical difficulties are in applying the 
gospel to specific moral issues, Luke set the Christian life within the framework of proclaiming 
peace and doing the things that make for peace, just as he set the life of Jesus within that same 
framework (see Lk 2:14; 19:38).—D.J.H. 

879. B. R. Gaventa, “The Eschatology of Luke-Acts Revisited,” Encounter A3 (1, ’82) 27-42. 

This article reviews the major positions on Luke’s eschatology since H. Conzelmann’s Die 
Mitte der Zeit (1953) and isolates the issues that have dominated the debate. Luke maintained 
that the parousia is a future fact and that its reality is to be affirmed in the face of either doubt or 
apocalyptic speculation. The parousia is guaranteed by the promises that have already been 
fulfilled, i.e. the promise of the Spirit and of the church’s witness (see Acts 1-2). The certainty 
of the parousia offers believers an alternative way of viewing themselves within the world. In 
the sense that believers are free to carry out a witness in the world and to converse with culture, 
human history is understood to be guided and directed by God’s will.—D.J.H. 

880. B. Prete, “‘II popolo che Dio si e scelto’ negli scritti di Luca,” SacDoc 26 (96, ’81) 
173-204. 

Luke used the term laos more frequently than any other NT writer (84 occurrences in 
Lk-Acts out of 141 occurrences in the NT). He employed it to signify God’s chosen people, 
composed of both Jews and non-Jews. Emphasizing the inclusion of the Gentiles, he alone of 
the Evangelists mentioned that prophets were sent to pagans (Lk 4:25-27). He conceived the 
gospel message as proclaimed boldly and without hindrance (Acts 28:31). Acts portrays how 
highly the first Christians esteemed hearing the message of salvation and responding to it in 
faith.—J.J.C. 

881. J. A. Sanders, “Isaiah in Luke,” Interpretation 36 (2, ’82) 144-155. 

Luke’s knowledge of Scripture evidently came from his assiduous reading of the Greek OT. 
Like his OT predecessors, he was a good theological historian. Of the four Evangelists, Luke 
insisted most explicitly that to understand what God was doing in Christ one had to know 
Scripture. There are quotations from the book of Isaiah in Lk 3:4-6; 4:18-19; and 22:37. Isaianic 
phrases appear in Lk 2:30-32; 7:22; 8:10; 19:46; and 20:9. Isa 49:6, which is quoted in Acts 13:47 
and reflected in Lk 1:79; 24:47; Acts 1:8; 26:20, apparently influenced the shape of the whole of 
Luke’s work. In Lk 4:16-30, the combination of Isa 61:1-2 and 58:6 stressed that the Jubilee 
would come at a time acceptable to God, that God’s agenda did not have to follow Israel’s 
agenda, and that God was free to release or forgive any or all of his creatures.—D.J.H.

According to Luke, prayer is a basic constituent of Christian life and activity. This attempt at 
indicating the salient aspects of Christian prayer in Lk-Acts is carried out in four stages: the 
basis of Christian prayer (the relationship of Christians to Christ and through him to the Father); 
prayer and Christian life (the Spirit, discernment and the revelation of God’s will, deliverance

Modern Scholarship,” TrinJourn 2 (2, ’81) 131-158. 

The article traces research from O. Pfleiderer’s work in 1873 to the present on what receiving 
the Spirit meant for Luke. G. W. H. Lampe and J. D. G. Dunn were right to insist that Luke 
drew intentional parallels between Jesus’ baptismal reception of the Spirit and the pentecostal 
gift bestowed on the disciples, but they were wrong to identify the gift of the Spirit on these two 
occasions as the matrix of Christian life. H. Gunkel, H. Leisegang, E. Schweizer, Lampe, and 
G. Haya-Prats were correct in pointing to Luke’s emphasis on the pentecostal gift of the Spirit 
as the Spirit of prophecy, but wrong in identifying this primarily with preaching or prophecy 
itself. They were perhaps also right to label this gift “charismatic,” but they were wrong to call 
it a donum superadditum. Gunkel, Schweizer, and Haya-Prats observed correctly that the gift 
of the Spirit of prophecy is not the matrix of Christian life, but they mistakenly inferred from 
this that Luke did not consider the Spirit as mediating salvation.—D.J.H.

The philological data in the OT and NT show that the clause andra ou ginosko in Lk 1:34 
refers to the state of virginity, and that aner with the article or a possessive or with reference to 
a woman can mean “husband.” That aner by itself can mean “husband” has been argued by 
J. B. Bauer [§ 9-945] on the basis of Jn 4:16 (“call your andra") and 4:17 (“I have no andra"). 
He understood the clause in Lk 1:34 to mean “I have no husband,” i.e. no marital relations. In 
Jn 4, however, the immediate context suggests the definition “husband,” which is not true of 
Lk 1:34. It seems better to translate the Lukan clause with its dynamic equivalent: “I am a 
virgin.”—J.J.C.

Luke’s account of Jesus’ baptism (3:21-22) omits any reference to Jesus’ coming up out of the 
water (cf. Mt 3:16; Mk 1:10) and adds a reference to Jesus’ prayer in connection with the open 
heavens. Luke alone used the word somatikos to describe the dove in the descent of the Holy 
Spirit. For Luke, only the simultaneous affirmation of the Son’s humanity and of his unique 
relationship to the Father—his essential deity—declared the fullness of Jesus’ person.—D.J.H.

The Jubilee legislation in Leviticus 25 provided for all property to be returned, all Israelite

practice. The proper understanding of the quotation from Isaiah 61 in Lk 4:18-19 is thoroughly 
consonant with the metaphorical and eschatological sense of the words in their OT context.

The parable of the builders in Lk 6:47-49 (see Mt 7:24-27) fits a life situation in the Galilean 
Jewish community of the 1st century A.D. It was spoken by Jesus to his disciples in a parallel-

parable compelled the disciples to place themselves in a state of complete obedience to Jesus as 
the only way to enter the kingdom of God.—D.J.H.

in thought and language between Isaiah 52-53 (LXX) and Lk 18:14 is striking, for it is only in 
these two biblical passages that the three terms “justify” {dikaiod, Isa 53:11), “be humbled” 
{tapeinod, Isa 53:8), and “be exalted” (hypsod, Isa 52:13) are found together. Although there

John knew the Synoptic tradition (at least Mk) but did not use it, because he himself was an 
eyewitness of Jesus. Neirynck maintains that John used the Synoptic tradition extensively in 
composing his Gospel. De Solages has made a significant contribution by quantifying the degree 
of similarity and difference of language and content between Jn and the Synoptic Gospels. 
Neirynck’s chief disagreement with M.-E. Boismard concerns the point at which the Synoptic 
Gospels became an important influence in the composition of the Fourth Gospel. The mystery

The most interesting feature to observe among the OT quotation formulas in the Fourth 
Gospel is the regularity of the hina plerdth^ formula from Jn 12:38 onward through the passion 
narrative. Whereas the signs in the first part of the Gospel were meant to prove that Jesus was 
the Messiah, the OT testimonia in the second part were meant to prove that the disgrace of the 
crucifixion was Jesus’ very purpose and, indeed, his hour of glorification.—D.J.H. 

899. J. N. Findlay, “Thoughts on the Gnosis of St John,” RelStud 17 (4, ’81) 441-450. 

When the Fourth Gospel is read from the appropriate hermeneutical perspective, it becomes 
a supreme “mystico-religious” document, capable of providing guidance at every turn of the 
spiritual life. The interpreter of Jn must conceive of God as being beyond category differences, 
transcending particularity and abstract universality, incorporating all those values (truth, love, 
beauty, justice, etc.) that are universality in action, and transcending personality and personal 
relationships while finding supreme expression in them. It is also possible for the interpreter to 
conceive of a kingdom in which all personal relationships will be perfected, and to put at the 
center of that kingdom something that still bears the features of the historic person in whom the 
gospel of the kingdom was first promulgated and lived. In the light of such a hermeneutics, the 
Fourth Gospel can truly illuminate the spirit instead of flooding it with the mere doctrinal 
bombast generated by a particularist reading.—D.J.H.

single author, (2) the lack of attention paid to the stylistic diversity within the Gospel, (3) the 
refusal to group verses on the basis of their containing or not containing characteristically 
Johannine linguistic features, and (4) the danger presented by using the statistical tables apart 
from the texts on which they are based. The assumption of linguistic unity has had a negative 
effect on Johannine research during the past thirty years, and constitutes an obstacle to careful

The Christology of Jesus as theos, in the sense that he is equal to God, was the crowning idea 
of Johannine theology. In proclaiming this kind of Christology, the Evangelist and his church 
risked conflict with the synagogue. The divinity of Jesus, which was connected with his cruci¬ 
fixion, was the reason why the Johannine Christians had to go through persecution and possible 
martyrdom.—D.J.H.

The Fourth Gospel’s pericopes about the Samaritan woman (4:4-42), Mary and Martha (11:1- 
44; 12:1-8), and Mary Magdalene (19:25; 20:1-2, 11-18) are significant for what they plainly say 
about the discipleship of Christian women. The Johannine women relate to Jesus directly and 
never through the mediation of men. They are not assigned a place or role by some third (male) 
party, and they are remarkable for their initiative and decisive action. If leadership is a function 
of creative initiative and decisive action, the Johannine women are well qualified for it. These 
women officially represent the Johannaie community in its expression of faith (Martha), its 
acceptance of salvation (Mary Magdalene), and its witness to the gospel (the Samaritan woman, 
Mary Magdalene).—D.J.H. 

904. M. Scott, “Images of the Spirit in John’s Gospel,” BibToday 20 (2, ’82) 78-83. 

John used three images to help us better understand the Holy Spirit: wind and breath, living 
water, and Paraclete. The idea of the permaneiu presence of the Holy Spirit aided the Johannine 
community in dealing with its crisis of faith by affirming that Jesus was still with them, having 
returned through the Spirit.—D.J.H. 

905. D. Senior, “The Gospel of John,” BibToday 20 (2, ’82) 70-77. 

The tradition contained in the Fourth Gospel originated in the context of Ist-century Pales¬ 
tinian Judaism. The Gospel took its present form during the later stages of the Johannine 
community’s history (ca. A.D. 80-100), but it reflects the earlier stages of that history also. 
Among the motifs in Jn that have been of particular interest to modem scholars are the Chris¬ 
tology of Jesus as the revealer of God; the relation between signs, faith, and the Spirit; and a 
divided world.—D.J.H.

In the Fourth Gospel, Nicodemus illustrates the process of faith and discipleship. He passes 
from questioning Jesus (3:1-21), through defending him (7:50-52), to assisting in the burial 
preparations and arrangements (19:39-42).—D.J.H. 

907. U. C.VON Wahlde, “The Johannine ‘Jews’: A Critical Survey,” jVr5md28 (1, ’82)33-60. 

Most modem scholars take the term loudaioi in the Fourth Gospel in its hostile sense as 
referring either to both the Jewish authorities and the Jewish people, or to the Jewish authorities 
only. But careful analysis of the relevant texts indicates that, with the exception of Jn 6:41, 52, 
to view the Johannine Jews as including the common people is to misread the evidence and 
distort the Evangelist’s intention. Of the seven problematic Ioudaioi-\.Q\is, five (3:25; 11:54; 
18:20; 19:20; 19:21) seem to belong to the neutral use; a combination of features makes it 
difficult to categorize the other two (8:31; 10:19) and suggests redactional activity.—D.J.H. 

908. A. Yarbro Collins, “New Testament Perspectives: The Gospel of John,” JournStudOT 
22 (’82) 47-53. 

Although the Fourth Gospel was rooted in a culture in which men were dominant and much of 
its language reflects that fact, it did not simply reinforce the sexist stmctures of its time. The 
experience of God through Christ could not be described purely in terms of masculine experi¬ 
ence. The community evoked by the mission of Christ was, in its origins and ideal form, a 
gathering of equals.—D.J.H.

The Logos confession in the Johannine Prologue dates from the mid-1st century, and became 
normative for Christians in Asia Minor and Egypt. Differing interpretations of it left their traces 
in Revelation, Jn, 1 John, the writings of the Apologists, and gnostic literature. In the 2nd 
century, the original Logos confession was read alongside the text of Jn with its interpolations; 
this disagreement may account for the church’s slow acceptance of the Fourth Gospel. 
Research into Jn continues, and much light can be expected to come from the Nag Hammadi 
documents.—J.J.C.

Esaie 25,” EtudTheolRel 57 (1, ’82) 119-120. 

When Jn 2:1-11 is read in light of Isa 25:1-9, the miracle at Cana appears as an eschatological 
sign: Jesus offers the long-expected banquet to the lowly and oppressed.—D.J.H.

Detailed analysis of Jn 2:23-3:21 suggests that the passage was a homily or a catechesis 
composed in its entirety by John, but rooted in an actual discussion between Jesus and 
Nicodemus. Perhaps only Jn 2:23-3:2 remains from the description of that event. The rest of the 
passage would then reflect the context of John and his audience: Vv. 3-4 (on the necessity of 
baptism) probably derive from and retain ipsissima verba, though slightly explained; vv. 5-10 
(on the role of the Spirit) present actual words of Jesus as well as community tradition; vv. 11-13 
(on teaching) retain Jesus’ words almost exclusively; vv. 14-16 (on redemption) give an explana¬ 
tion with the words; and vv. 17-21 (on judgment) paraphrase Jesus’ words. In addition to the 
actual words of Jesus, John also used material based on the OT that had originated in the 
communities of Paul and the Synoptic Evangelists, though his interpretation always stands out. 
John’s communities were neither closed nor highly individualized. He knew of other communi¬ 
ties, kept in contact with them, and made use of the traditions they were developing.—J.P. 

914. [Jn 3:1-21] M. Michel, ‘‘Nicodeme ou le non-lieu de la verite,” RevSciRel 55 (4, ’81) 
227-236. 

The story of Nicodemus in Jn 3:1-21 consists of a narrative (vv. l-2a), a dialogue (vv. 2b-10), 
and a discourse (vv. 11-21). It focuses on the interpretation of the signs accomplished by Jesus 
and on the perception of Jesus himself. The passage presents the Christian hermeneutic face to 
face with the Pharisaic hermeneutic. New birth in baptism (see v. 5) is shown to be the condition 
for believing in Jesus as the sign par excellence.—D.J.H. 

915. J. D. Thomas, “A Translation Problem—John 3:8,” RestorQuart 24 (4, ’81) 219-224. 

The phrase to pneuma . . . pnei in Jn 3:8 probably refers to the Holy Spirit, and phone must 
mean an intelligible, reasonable message. A free translation might read: “The Spirit inspires 
whomever he chooses, and you comprehend the message thus produced though you cannot 
sensually discern the Spirit’s action. In this way is everyone begotten who is begotten by the 
Spirit.”—D.J.H.

The narrative of Jesus’ encounter with the Samaritan woman in Jn 4:1-42 consists of a 
connecting introduction (vv. 1-4) and five chiastically contrasted sections, with the literary 
accent in the central section: A—meeting of Jesus and the Samaritan woman at the well 
(vv. 5-9), B—dialogue on living water (vv. 10-15), C—dialogue on true worship (vv. 16-26), 
B'—dialogue on true food (vv. 27-38), A'—meeting of Samaritans and Jesus (vv. 39-42). Within 
each section, various repetitive devices are used for emphasis. The theme of the narrative is 
true worship, and the controlling metaphor is betrothal.—D.J.H.

Communication,” EcumRev 34 (1, ’82) 8-34. 

In this meditation on Jn 4:1-42, a dozen forceful and relevant statements about communica¬ 
tion are drawn from the text. The resulting commentary is an “appropriation,” by which a text 
of the past becomes again living speech. Everyday, impossible, verbal, dialogical, poetic, 
existential, and theological communications enter into the conversation between Jesus and the 
Samaritan woman. God is manifested in the epiphany of Christ; the Samaritan woman is 
transformed into a witness practicing narrative communication; and the Samaritans, upon 
hearing her, appropriate her testimony, verifying it from Jesus himself. But communication is 
only for a time. Beyond the horizon of communication is the time of communion.—E.G.B. 

918. A. Niccacci, “Siracide 6,19 e Giovanni 4,36-38,” BibOr 23 (3, ’81) 149-153. 

Like the description of the apostolate in Jn 4:36-38, Sir 6:19 and 51:16 tell how in the search 
for wisdom the sower and the reaper labor little and obtain a rich harvest. The two texts derive 
independently from OT tradition. Neither the apostolate nor the search for wisdom is bound by 
earthly laws; both enjoy rapid growth and an extraordinary abundance.—J.J.C.

The core of the bread-of-life discourse in Jn 6:35-58 contains two parallel developments: “I 
am” declaration by Jesus (vv. 35-40, 51), objection by the Jews (vv. 41-42, 52), response by 
Jesus (vv. 43-47, 53-57), and conclusion (vv. 49-50, 58). The contents of the two parts corre¬ 
spond to what is said in v. 33: the origin of Jesus (“for the bread of God is that which comes 
down from heaven”), and the mission and destiny of Jesus (“and gives life to the world”).—

The words egd eimi in Jn 8:24 should be understood as a reference to Jesus’ messiahship [see 
§ 24-145]. In the highly creative chaps. 7-8, John revealed his knowledge of various aspects of 
Jewish messianic belief, including several OT texts. In Jn 8:24, egd eimi expressed John’s 
unique concept of Jesus as the Messiah. Unless the Jews believed in the Messiah, they would 
die in their sins. Yet the Messiah remained hidden to Jewish understanding, so the disbelief and 
controversy of most Jews with Jesus continued (see 8:27-59).—D.J.H. 

921. M. DE Merode, “L’accueil triomphal de Jesus se\on Jean, 11-12,” RevTheolLouv 13 (1, 
’82) 49-62. 

The Johannine account of Jesus’ triumphal reception in Jerusalem (Jn 12:12-19) differs from 
its Synoptic parallels (Mt 21:1-9; Mk 11:1-10; Lk 19:28-40) in three respects: Jesus finds the 
young ass after the crowd’s acclamation; he is acclaimed King of Israel; and the crowds use 
branches of palm trees. The Evangelist deliberately oriented his account toward the Feast of 
Tabernacles and the eschatological hopes attached to it. He also related the scene to the 
death-resurrection of Lazarus (see Jn 12:9-12, 17-19) and to Jesus’ glorious death. Jesus appears 
not merely as the Messiah who announced the kingdom (Mt) or began it (Lk), but as the 
expected kingdom itself. In his person Jesus makes present the glory of the kingdom.—D.J.H.

Three questions concerning the footwashing in Jn 13:4-5 are addressed here: (1) Why did 
Jesus wash the disciples’ feet rather than their hands, and why did he do this after the meal 
instead of before it? (2) Why did Jesus wear the towel that he would use to wipe the disciples’ 
feet? (3) Why did he disrobe before girding on the towel? The motif of self-sacrifice and 
self-abnegation is conveyed by Jesus’ radical act of washing the disciples’ feet in polar opposi¬ 
tion to Pharisaic practice. The motif of confrontation instead of evasion of the coming violence 
is conveyed by Jesus’ disrobing and girding himself with the towel, which replaces the ancient 
wrestling belt as a symbol.—E.G.B. 


923. F. Moloney, “John 17: The Prayer of Jesus’ Hour,’’ ClerRev 67 (3, ’82) 79-83. 

At three points in Jn 17:1-26, Jesus either assumes an attitude of prayer (v. 1) or announces 
solemnly that he is praying for some specific group (vv. 9, 20). Jesus prays to the Father for 
himself (vv. 1-8), for his own (vv. 9-19), and for those who believe in him through their word 
(vv. 20-26). In this hour, Jesus prays not primarily as a priest but rather as the Son to the Father 
united in the deepest bond of loving obedience.—D.J.H.

Taking as his starting point the traditional story of the passion of Jesus, John sought to spell 
out all the deepest religious truths hidden but implied in the events of that fateful day on which 
the Son of God was crucified. Every incident in Jn 18:1-19:42 is a finite sign of the unutterable 
love of the all-powerful and eternal God.—D.J.H.

Did John intend his readers at Jn 19:13 to envision Jesus, or Pilate, on the throne of judgment? 
The proposal that the Evangelist used the verb ekathisen in a deliberately ambiguous way 
requires the performance of impossible mental gymnastics. The philological arguments support¬ 
ing the view that ekathisen was used transitively (i.e. Pilate seated Jesus) are open to serious 
objections. Furthermore, the possibility that ekathisen was used transitively in Jn 19:13 cannot 
be reinforced by invoking the evidence of Gospel of Peter 3:7 and Justin’s Apology 1.35.6. [To

In Acts, the resurrection of Jesus is assumed to involve a call to repentance. Whether in 
Jerusalem, Caesarea, Antioch in Pisidia, or Athens, the apostles represented the resurrection 
not only as an extraordinary sign but also as an event effecting a fundamental change in people’s 
lives and opening up a new universe. The twelve apostles and Paul bore witness to the divine

with Paul at the “apostolic council’’ in Jerusalem issuing in the acceptance of the new 
Antiochean understanding of the gospel (Gal 2:1-10), and his conflict with Paul about the 
meaning of the council’s decree (Gal 2:13). Barnabas found himself in the midst of the tensions 
and conflicts surrounding the expansion of the church beyond Jerusalem and Israel and the 
determination of the place of Gentiles in it. Thus he exemplified the complex situation of the

(4:23-31); and the final period (4:32-35). The whole passage exhibits a chiastic structure: A— 
initial situation (2:42-47), B—healing and discourse (3:1-26), C—inverted situation (4:1-4), B'—

traditional expressions in Acts 3:13-15; 5:30; 10:39-40; 13:27-30; 2:23-24; and 2:36. On the basis 
of the recurring elements in those passages, it is possible to reconstruct the original wording of 
the formula: “Jesus, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead.” This contrast 
formula was part of the missionary preaching of the earliest Jewish-Christian community.—

In Acts 6:1-7, Luke did not set out to portray the appointment of deacons but rather to 
establish the possibility of the continuance of church offices. The passage should be read in 
connection with the choice of the twelve apostles and their being sent forth (Lk 6:12-16; 9:1-6, 
10), the choice and sending forth of the seventy disciples (Lk 10:1-20), and the election of 
Matthias (Acts 1:15-26). Despite his familiarity with the office of deacon and the presence of the 
term diakonia or diakonein in the traditional account (see Acts 6:1, 2, 4), Luke consciously 
avoided the noun diakonos. —D.J.H.

Two noticeable tendencies were at work in Luke’s composition of Acts 7:42b-43 using Amos 
5:25-27 and of Acts 15:16-17 using Amos 9:11-12: (1) While very faithful to his Septuagint 
source, Luke did not hesitate to impose on the OT quotations a certain number of stylistic, 
thematic, or manifestly theological modifications. (2) The scriptural texts had considerable 
influence on the composition of Acts. Luke chose his texts with diligence, repeatedly employed 
their numerous themes, imitated their style, borrowed their vocabulary, and wove the passages 
into the very fabric of his narratives and speeches.—D.J.H.

Although the three stories about Paul’s conversion/call in Acts share similar motifs and 
purport to describe the same incident, they utilize different literary modes: Acts 9:1-19 is 
basically a miracle story about the healing of Paul’s blindness; Acts 22:4-16 is a healing narra¬ 
tive that has been redacted into a commissioning narrative; and Acts 26:12-18 is a commission¬ 
ing narrative. Luke has composed the three narratives so that they supplement, complement, 
and correct one another. In fact, the complete Lukan story can only be determined by bringing 
together features from all three narratives. In the light of Luke’s literary technique, the tensions 
and nonagreements among the three accounts should be understood as improvements and 
corrections.—D.J.H.

Most of the allusions to the Jesus-tradition in the Pauline letters occur in Romans 12-14, 
1 Thessalonians 4-5, Colossians 'i-4, and 1 Corinthians. Paul seems to have known the sources 
behind Mk 9:33-50; Lk 6:27-38; and Mk 6:6b-13 parr., as well as a passion narrative, a collection 
of conflict stories, and several isolated sayings. The pattern of the Pauline-Synoptic parallels 
testifies that Paul had received and probably passed on collections whose content purportedly 
derived from Jesus.—D.J.H.

In the context of the social realities of Paul’s situation, his ability to retain his authority as a 
leader must have depended both on his ability to persuade people to give him recognition and on 
his ability to broaden his appeal in the face of strong competition. The ideology of Christ 
crucified was well suited to Paul’s task for several reasons: its origin in tradition, its natural 
appeal to the socioeconomically powerless, its possible appeal even to wealthy people, its 
inversion of the spiritual and moral ideas and institutions of the day, and its stark simplicity. Its 
structure as negation, or reversal, provided the basis for developing an alternative symbolic 
world and consequently an alternative society with distinctive group boundaries, social 
patterns, leadership structure, moral order, theodicy, and propaganda.—D.J.H. 

942. R. B. Cook, “Paul, the Organizer,” Missiology [Elkhart, IN] 9 (4, ’81) 485-498. 

Paul was the leader of a team that practiced division of labor, followed a fixed itinerary, and 
developed strategies for establishing communities of believers. Paul’s evangelistic activity 
involved concrete, specific actions in obedience to the crucified Messiah; it meant action in 
service, not simply preaching.—D.J.H. 

943. R. B. Cook, “St Paul—Preacher, Evangelist or Organizer?” ExpTimes 93 (6, ’82) 171- 
173. 

The English word “preach” does not convey the wide range of meaning that euangelizomai 
had for Paul [see § 26-562]. Paul “preached Jesus” in his life-style and in his work as a 
missionary-organizer and activist. His evangelistic activity involved concrete, specific actions 
in obedience to the crucified Messiah.—D.J.H. 

944. O. CULLMANN, “La priere selon les Epitres pauliniennes,” Tantiir Yearbook [Jerusalem] 
(’77-’78) 67-82. 

The first part of the article discusses various aspects of Paul’s practice of prayer: spontaneous 
and liturgical prayers, prayers for particular churches, the churches’ prayers for the apostle, 
perseverance, intensity, joy, the power of the Spirit, and human weakness. The second part 
considers Paul’s understanding of prayer as it is developed in Rom 8:15-30, with special 
emphasis on the idea of prayer as a gift from God.—D.J.H. 

945. P. Dacquino, “La chiesa ‘corpo del Cristo,”’ RivistBih 29 (3-4, ’81) 315-330. 

The term “body of Christ” summarizes Paul’s doctrine of the church, which depends on the 
OT concept of corporate personality and the Semitic idea of the body as an instrument of the 
self. The “body of Christ” is the Christian community (understood either locally as in 1 Cor 
12:27 or universally as in Colossians and Ephesians), in which the glorified Savior continues to

be present and to act in his earthly members. As head of the body, Christ is part of the church 
(see 1 Cor 12:14-21); he should not be pictured as influencing the body from outside, for in that 
case the body would be only a trunk.—J.J.C. 

946. G. Dautzenberg, “Paulus und das Alte Testament,” BibKirch 37 (I, ’82) 21-27. 

This examination of Paul’s understanding and use of the OT explains the attitudes toward 
Scripture that he shared with other Jewish writers of his time, and the distinctively early 
Christian interpretation of the OT in light of the Christ-event. Then it considers Paul’s refer¬ 
ences to the OT and the biblical style of his own writings, his view of the OT as law and 
promise, his designation of OT figures as models or types, and his reflections on letter and spirit 
and on the old and new covenants.—D.J.H.

[Autarkes and autarkeia according to the Stoics and the Apostle Paul], DeltBibMel 9 (2, 
’80) 17-34. 

The essential difference in the use of the terms autarkes (”s,elf-sufficient”) and autarkeia 
(“self-sufficiency”) by the Stoics and Paul (Phil 4:11; 2 Cor 9:8; 1 Tim 6:6) is that for Paul they 
had a Christocentric (“living according to Christ”) meaning and for the Stoics an anthropo¬ 
centric (“living according to nature”) meaning. To the Stoics these terms signified personal 
achievement, individual perfection, independence from God, and detachment from worldly 
things viewed as causing evil. To the apostle they expressed aspects of the life of grace deter¬ 
mined by faith in Christ, and involved sharing with one’s neighbor.—Th.S. 

948. R. Hughes, “The Cain Complex and the Apostle Paul,” Soundings [Nashville, TN] 55 (1, 
’82) 5-22. 

The “Cain complex” as defined by L. Szondi refers to the son who loves his father and hates 
his brother. Paul’s vocational choice (see Gal 1:13-14; Phil 3:5-6; Acts 9:1-22) was destiny¬ 
determining and involved the Cain complex. With his turnabout from Cain to Abel, Paul estab¬ 
lished a projective-participatory relationship with God. Though it did not annul his Cain lethal¬ 
ity, this relationship allowed Paul’s Abel feelings to flourish in his interpersonal life; his task 
was to socialize his Cain nature in missionary work by becoming an energetic, restless, and 
aggressive defender of the faith. Recognition of Paul’s Cain complex illuminates his illness, his 
understanding of sin and conscience, and his vision of the community.—D.J.H. 

949. M. J. Joseph, “Paul’s Understanding of‘Independence’ in his Ministry,” Biblebhashyam 
1 (4, ’81) 225-238. 

Paul expressed his independence not simply to do what he wanted to do, but to fulfill his 
missionary obligation as the apostle to the Gentiles. Paul believed that his gospel and apostle- 
ship were two sides of the same coin, that he had to assert his independence from the Jerusalem 
apostles, and that he had the freedom to relinquish his legitimate apostolic rights for the sake of 
the gospel.—D.J.H.

In Lutheran and other circles, Paul has often been understood as the one who set Judaism and 
the gospel in radical opposition. However, in Rom 1 l:28b-29 Paul insisted that Jews retain their

election, whether they believe the gospel or not. According to Rom 4:16, Jews who do not 
believe nevertheless qualify as the seed and progeny of Abraham. According to Rom 15:8, 
Christ has become and still is a servant (diakonos) of the Jewish people. Paul presupposed a 
continuing ministry of the earthly Jesus/risen Christ to Israel, but he did not think out what that 
might mean if the parousia tarried.—D.J.H. 

951. R. F. O’Toole, ‘The Humane St. Paul,” RevRel 41 (1, ’82) 80-90. 

Paul’s letters show that he was a humane person. This dimension of his character was 
demonstrated by his ability to attract people, his admission of personal weakness, closeness to 
his communities, apostleship, patience, affection, caring, attitude toward money, gratitude, 
reconciliation, challenge to other Christians, reaching out, and support for other church 
leaders.—D.J.H. 


952. A. G. Quenum, “D’etre nouveau du Chretien, fondement de sa libene,” EuntDoc 34 (3, 
’81) 393-408. 

According to Paul, because of the love of the Father (Rom 8:3) and of the Son (Gal 2:20) Chris¬ 
tians are a new creation (Gal 6:15). Their newness is the basis of their freedom from the law of 
sin and death (Rom 8:2). This freedom, however, should not be the occasion for selfishness, but 
should manifest itself in the love and service of others (Gal 5:13).—J.J.C. 

953. B. Rey, “Vie de foi et vie filiale selon saint Paul,” MelSciRel 39 (1, ’82) 3-18. 

Study of Paul’s references to Christ as the Son of God and to the filial adoption of Christ (e.g. 
Gal 4:4-7) indicates the close relationship established by Paul between the gift of filiation and 
the gift of faith. Christians become God’s children through the faith that the Son exhibited in his 
life. The Son is God’s yes, the yes of God’s creation in answer to Adam’s no, the eternal yes of 
the Father (see 2 Cor 1:19-22).—D.J.H. 

954. E. Trocme, “Paul-la-colere: eloge d’un schismatique,” RevHistPhilRel 61 (4, ’81) 341-

Besides being a great theologian and a fearless missionary, Paul was a rebel who, having had 
enough of the authoritarian practices of the Jerusalem church and of James, threw himself into 
schism in order to defend his right to use the Diaspora synagogues to preach the gospel to the 
Gentiles. Paul was also a loser who, some ten years later, confronted with failure, surrendered 
and vanished into obscurity. But in the meantime he was so amazingly stimulated by the 
struggle, that he opened for Christianity the door to the future, which had hardly been ajar until 
then.—D.J.H. 

955. H.-J.vander Minde, “Wie geht Paulus mit derTradition um?” 37 (1, ’82)6-13. 

Paul’s gospel was firmly based in revelation (see Gal 1:11-2:14; 1 Cor 15:8-11), and only in the 
service of that gospel did he use the traditional confessions, hymns, and acclamations. Not 
satisfied with simply repeating the tradition, Paul corrected it (Rom 1:3-4), connected it with his 
own theology (Rom 3:25-26), and directed it to the situation of the community (1 Cor 11:23-25; 
15:3-5).—D.J.H.

[NTA 26 (3, ’82) 



opposition between Jesus the Messiah and the Law—an opposition that he later brought to bear 
on his attitude toward the Gentile mission. In 1 Corinthians, Paul referred to the Torah as 
the authoritative source of the divine will and described Christians as being “in” rather than 

under the Law (see 1 Cor 9:19-23). In 2 Cor 3:4-18 he contrasted the gospel with the Law, 
defining the latter as “letter,” death-producing, and obsolete. The epistles to the Philippians 
and the Galatians responded to opponents who objected to the Law-free status of the Gentile- 
Christian communities. In the debate about circumcision, the theme of the Law became 
the center of contention, with Paul arguing for a radical departure from Torah observance (cf. 
Gal 5:13-15) and the limited functions of the Law. Paul’s position on the Law in Romans was a 
revision of his polemical stance in Philippians and Galatians.—D.J.H.

Paul’s invitations to become imitators of him are clarified when they are understood as 
expressions of his paraenetic authority rather than as attempts at setting himself up as a model. 
The theme of imitation in the Pauline epistles is explored here with reference to imitation of

authenticating criteria for determining moral disposition, paraenesis in the name of God or 
Jesus, and the possibility of imitating God.—D.J.H.

Romerbriefs zur Emeuerung des Verhaltnisses zwischen Christen und Juden,” TheolBeitr 
13 (2, ’82) 59-72. 

The fundamental problem facing Paul in his letter to the Romans was the relationship 
between Jews and non-Jews. This thesis is confirmed by the historical setting of the letter, the 
theology of mission expressed in Rom 1:16-17, the argument about the wrath of God (1:18-3:20) 
and the righteousness of God (3:21^:25), and the train of thought in chaps. 9-11. Both the 
gospel and the election of Israel were important to Paul.—D.J.H. 

959. R. Jewett, “Romans as an Ambassadorial Letter,” Interpretation 36 (1, ’82) 5-20. 

Among Paul’s letters, Romans is a unique fusion of the ambassadorial letter with several 
other types: the paraenetic letter, the hortatory letter, and the philosophical diatribe. Its 
purpose was to advocate in behalf of the “power of God” a cooperative mission to evangelize 
Spain. Thus the theological argument reiterated the gospel to be proclaimed, and the ethical 
admonitions showed how that gospel was to be lived out in a manner that would ensure the 
success of the mission. After reviewing the evidence for Paul’s understanding of himself as an 
ambassador, the article sets forth the textual evidence for regarding Romans as an ambas¬ 
sadorial letter (see 1:1-17; 15:14—16:23) and describes the interpretative consequences of this 
hypothesis.—D.J.H.

If P. S. Minear’s division of the letter to the Romans (The Obedience of Faith, 1971) accord¬

translation of many passages. This article indicates those passages and some of the recent 
translations that make explicit the weak-strong conflict in Romans, calls attention to some 
translations of passages that have obscured or changed the meaning, and suggests additional 
passages where the weak-strong conflict needs to be made more explicit in order to preserve the 
correct meaning.—D.J.H.

Without stepping back from the gospel of the boundless grace of God for everyone who 
believes, Paul in Romans undertook to think through the great traditions of the Law, the 
promises, the election of Israel, messianism, and so forth. He insisted on Jesus as both Messiah 
of Israel and Lord of the Gentiles, the God of the Fathers as the God of Jesus, the upholding of 
the Law in the service of grace (see Rom 3:31), and the abiding theological significance of Israel 
for the church.—D.J.H.

There are problems with reading the genitives as subjective in the three phrases employing 
pistis in Rom 3:22, 25, and 26, but they are small compared with those facing the objective 
rendering found in all the modem translations and purveyed without question by the major 
commentaries. In fact, the subjective faith of Jesus was central to Paul’s presentation of the 
gospel. Jesus’ faith, understood as obedience, was soteriologically significant and provided the 
basis for the faith-response of others. This understanding did no violence to the principle of 
righteousness apart from the works of the Law (see Rom 3:22, 30), nor was the point of Jesus’ 
faith that it was just like the faith of Christians. Paul’s point was that, by virtue of the gift of the 
Spirit, the faith of Christians might become like that of Jesus.—D.J.H.

Spirit in the Son toward the Father (vv. 14-17). This text is closely connected with the psycho¬ 
logical conflict that only the Spirit of God can grant us to resolve'(Rom 7:7-25) and the perspec¬

Examination of Paul’s OT quotations in Romans 9-11 reveals a coherent pattern in each 
chapter: the preamble alluding to the history of salvation; the quotations from Genesis and 
Exodus in chap. 9, from Leviticus and Deuteronomy in chap. 10, and from 1 Samuel and 
1 Kings plus a return to Deuteronomy in chap. 11; and the quotations from the Prophets and 
other OT books as confirmations of Paul’s statements. The direct or indirect subject of the 
quotations in chaps. 9 and 11 is usually God; in chap. 10 it is the people of Israel. Paul quoted 
most often (though not exclusively) from the Septuagint, frequently simplifying and actualizing 
the text. With this collection of texts from the Torah, Paul wished to show that Christ was the 
end of the Torah (see Rom 10:4).—D.J.H.

In spite of the limitations of what Rom 13:1-7 says about the Christian with regard to the 
authority of the state, we can learn much from this text concerning the divine plan, the context 
of the Christian vocation, the danger of confusing the religious character of the state with its 
Christian character, the state’s responsibility to maintain the public order, and the need for 
constant vigilance and discernment.—D.J.H.

underlying source support the hypothesis of a Hellenistic-Jewish origin. Comparison with 
parallel passages in the NT (1 Pet 2:13-17; 1 Tim 2:1-3; Tit 3:1-3) shows that the literary 
structure of Rom 13:1-7 is unique. (3) Paul used the passage in his call for more humble behavior 
on the part of the Gentile Christians at Rome. Submissiveness to the Roman authorities was 
both part of the command to love one another and trust in the Lord, and a step in the unfolding 
of God’s eschatological plan of judgment, wrath, and salvation.—D.J.H.

In order to understand better Paul’s pastoral relationship with the Corinthian church, this 
article first considers his attitude toward women as church leaders (1 Cor 11:2-16; 14:33b-36), as 
sex objects (1 Cor 6:12-20), and as wives, lovers, and mothers (1 Cor 7:1-40). Then under the

972. [1-2 Cor] S. E. Johnson , “Paul in the Wicked City of Corinth,’’ LexTheolQuart 17 (2, ’82) 
59-67. 

After sketching the history of ancient Corinth, the article discusses Paul’s dealings with the 
Corinthian community as they are recounted in Acts 18:1-17 and 1-2 Corinthians. It was all too 
easy for the cosmopolitan Corinthians to forget that their freedom came from the crucified 
Christ. In his Corinthian correspondence, Paul started with ethics and spirituality and moved 
from there to theology.—D.J.H. 

973. [1 Cor] E. Schussler Fiorenza, “Tablesharing and the Celebration of the Eucharist,’’ 
Concilium 152 (’82) 3-12. 

The church at Corinth had problems of self-identity vis-a-vis pagan society as well as prob¬ 
lems integrating the diverse ecclesial and social groups within the community. Paul sought to 
strengthen group identity among the Corinthian Christians by appealing to the spatial and social 
image of the body. He also stressed the symbolic-integrative center of “tablesharing,’’ which 
the Christian association had in common with other cultic and private associations. He did so in 
order to draw boundaries between the Christian group and other associations while strengthening 
unity among the Christians. Thus the two “eucharistic” passages (1 Cor 10:1-22; 11:2-34) were 
crucial for Paul’s theological argument and ecclesial goal. Contemporary eucharistic discussions 
might gain new dimensions and impulses if they would focus on the “meal” character of the 
Eucharist as constitutive for the symbolic ritualization of the Christian community, and work for 
the overcoming of societal discrimination and prejudice as its essential precondition.—D.J.H. 

974. [1 Cor] G.-P. Widmer, “La parole de la croix et le langage du monde,” CommViat 24 (3,

Paul’s development of the opposition between the “word of the cross” as the wisdom of God 
and the “wisdom of the world” with its persuasive discourse shows that he found a language 
adequate to his message. There was a direct connection between the manner in which Paul 
addressed the Corinthians and the situation of the community that he sought to restructure.—

the question of the inspiration of the Scriptures. Determined in content and structure by the 
phrase sophian de laloiinien en tois teleiois in v. 6, the passage describes the wisdom of God 
(vv. 6-9), the revelation and inspiration of God (vv. 10-13), and the illumination of Scripture 
(vv. 14-16). Paul believed that all Scripture was inspired by God (see 2 Tim 3:16-17) in words 
taught not by human wisdom but by the Holy Spirit.—D.J.H. 

976. A. Hanson, “1 Corinthians 4:13b and Lamentations 3:45,” ExpTimes 93 (7, ’82) 214-215. 

It seems probable that Paul’s words perikatharmata and peripsema in 1 Cor 4:13b reflect the 
Hebrew terms mads and sehi in Lam 3:45. But if there is a line of interpretation connecting 
these two verses, it passes through the sufferings of Christ.—D.J.H.

The statement in 1 Cor 7:1 that “it is well for a man not to touch a woman” is neither an 
assertion of Paul’s own position nor a Corinthian slogan that he accepted. In fact, the interpreta¬ 
tion of the statement as a Corinthian slogan that Paul rejected fits the context of 1 Corinthians 
6-7 much better. Rather than criticizing Paul for discouraging the physical aspects of marriage, 
it is more justifiable to fault him for failing to deal sufficiently with its spiritual qualities.—

Paul’s formulation of the dominical prohibition of divorce in 1 Cor 7:10-11 referred to a 
particular case at Corinth: A wife who had been unsuccessful in obtaining conjugal rights from 
her ascetic husband was in the process of being divorced by him (see 1 Cor 7:3-4). Paul refused 
to allow this divorce, because he considered the grounds to be insufficient. But in 7:15 he 
permitted a divorce, because he found the reason convincing.—D.J.H.

The teachings, norms, and guidelines for Christian life presented by Paul in 1 Corinthians 
12-14 were part of his effort to provide leadership for a community he had already founded. The 
spiritual development of the Corinthians, which Paul desired and encouraged from the start, 
was taking place in an unexpected and unacceptable way. Paul’s task was to evaluate the 
Christian and spiritual growth of the Corinthians, to persuade the “perfects” and the prophets 
among them to accept the authority of his teachings, and to point to love rather than the search 
for spiritual gifts as the highest goal of Christian life.—D.J.H.

to destruction and many to salvation: (1) He was not afraid to preach the undiluted truth. (2) The i 

Holy Spirit had changed the lives of the Corinthians through his ministry. (3) Like the ministry 
of the old covenant, Paul’s own ministry was so glorious that some turned away from it. 

(4) Unlike the ministry of Moses, his ministry took away the veil of hardheartedness.—D.J.H. J

M. E. Thrall’s identification of the “super-apostles” in 2 Cor 11:5; 12:11 as the Jerusalem ; 

apostles [§ 24-901] does not prove that the authority Paul’s opponents claimed from Jerusalem j 

actually existed. In 2 Cor 11:22 Paul may have been merely indicating what the opponents 
claimed for themselves, without passing judgment on those claims. Even the description of 
them as Jewish Christians is not entirely certain.—D.J.H.

The phrase “thorn in the flesh” in 2 Cor 12:7 does not refer to illness of any kind. Analysis of 
the various suggested semantic domains (object-physical; event-psychological; abstract- 
physical; event-interpersonal) reveals that the phrase was an ironic wordplay referring to the 
irritation caused by the false apostles in Corinth—ironic because the viciousness of their attacks 
taught the apostle humility. The thorn was not removed by a “charismatic” healing; instead, 
Paul was shown that real charis consisted in adopting the crucified Jesus’ attitude toward 
suffering.—B.C.L.

The phrase “thorn in the flesh” in 2 Cor 12:7 is an idiomatic expression functioning seman¬ 
tically as a causative, and lexically meaning “that which causes hardship.” In 2 Cor 12:7, it is 
not the definition but the reference of the phrase that is problematic. As already stated by 
various early Christian writers, the expression can only refer to Paul’s suffering in the service of 
the gospel.—B.C.L.

After surveying the theories on the structure of Galatians proposed by J. Bligh, S. Lyonnet, 
K. L. Schmidt, and H. D. Betz, the article argues that no single criterion, external or internal, 
suffices to decide the issue, and that one must weigh not only the thought content but also all 
pertinent literary considerations (e.g. chiasmus, literary genres, parallelisms, inclusions, key 
words, and stereotyped expressions). Using these aids, it outlines the epistle as follows: intro¬ 
duction (1:1-10); body (1:11-6:10) consisting of an autobiographical narrative (1:11-2:21), scrip¬ 
tural arguments (3:1-4:31), and paraenetic applications (5:1-6:10); and epilogue (6:11-18).—

aux Galates et aux Remains,” EuntDoc 34 (2, ’81) 267-286. 

After describing the historical context of Paul’s letters to the Galatians and the Romans, the 
article explains why Paul insisted on Christian freedom with regard to the Law, and sketches his 
understanding of freedom as a consequence of the work of God in Christ and through the Spirit. 
The death and resurrection of Christ destroyed all the forces that enslaved people and separated 
them from God. But the freedom to which God calls us is accomplished injustice, sanctifica¬ 
tion, and mutual love. By living according to the Spirit, we show in our everyday lives that we 
have been freed.—D.J.H.

In Greek literature the use of peithd with theos as its object indicated a preliminary stage in a 
magical or imprecatory action. The double question in Gal 1:10a {Arti gar anthrdpoiis peithd e 
ton theon;) concludes the exordium (Gal 1:6-9) and prepares for the narration (1:11-2:14). The 
sarcastic aspect of Paul’s use of peithd with reference to God cannot be ignored.—D.J.H.

The doctrinal section in Galatians (3:1-6:10) functioned as a prelude to the argument in 
Romans 1-8: the preparation of the Christian economy (Gal 3:1-29; Rom 1:18-5:11), the deci¬ 
sive intervention of Christ in the religious history of humanity (Gal 4:1-20; Rom 5:12-7:6), and 
the liberating action of the Spirit as the fruit of Christ’s intervention (Gal 4:21-6:10; 
Rom 7:6-8:39). At each stage of the argument in Romans, Paul referred to the origins of human 
history (see Rom 1:18-23; 5:12-21; 7:7-25).—D.J.H.

After the preamble (3:1-5) to the doctrinal part of the epistle to the Galatians, the argument 
proceeds in three steps: the preparation by God in Abraham of universal salvation brought 
about by Christ (3:6-29); the subjection of all humanity prior to Christ and the redemptive 
incarnation (4:1-20); and filiation according to the Spirit in the Jerusalem on high (the church), 
Christian freedom, and the Holy Spirit (4:21-6:10). This tripartite structure reflects the several 
phases of salvation history and supplies the outline for Romans 1-8.—D.J.H.

Times 93 (7, ’82) 196-200. 

Paul’s argument in Gal 3:10-14 exhibits the following logical structure: If those who rely on 
works of the Law are under a curse (v. 10), if they cannot be justified in the eyes of God on the 
grounds of obedience to the Torah (v. 11), if they are not people of faith (v. 11), and if, on the 
other hand, Christians are freed and saved by Christ’s atoning death (v. 13), then those who 
seek to base their salvation on works of the Law cannot be those who inherit the blessing given 
to Abraham; and if they are not the heirs, then the heirs must be the Gentiles, who have 
received their salvation through Jesus Christ (v. 14). What Paul struggled so passionately to

affirm about freedom in faith and divine acceptance remains at the heart of the Christian

VetChrist 18 (2, ’81) 341-355. 

In Gal 4:27, Paul quoted Isa 54:1 while developing his contrast between the church as the 
heavenly Jerusalem and the Jewish synagogues as the earthly Jerusalem. The liturgical use of 
the OT verse in connection with baptism is suggested by 2 Clement 2: 1-3 and Justin’s Dialogue 
with Trypho 52:10-54:6. It was also used in theological argument by Justin, Irenaeus, and 
Clement of Alexandria.—D.J.H.

With J. Habermas’s critical theory of a society oriented to practice as its starting point, the 
article proposes a reading of Gal 5:16-24 according to which Paul was illustrating the principle of 
the right use of freedom from the law (Gal 5:13-14). This typically paraenetic pericope is 
examined in terms of its literary structure, its semantic structure, and its functional structure. 
The analysis of the literary and semantic structures clarifies the value of the term “law’’ and the 
analogy between the “spirit-flesh’’ dialectic and the “spirit-law’’ dialectic. The analysis of the 
functional structure in a dynamic scheme of the original unity of kerygma and paraenesis 
enlarges the hermeneutical horizon; the method employed embraces the internal problems of 
the community, seen as the locus where theory and practice interact by a right understanding of 
the kerygma and a concrete actualization of its practical implications.

This article examines the quotation and use of Ps 68:18 in Eph 4:8-10; Isa 57:19 in Eph 2:17;

Eph 6:14-17. The absence of the promise-and-fulfillment function of Scripture in Ephesians 
reinforced the discontinuity between the OT and the new situation expressed in Eph 3:5. 
Nevertheless, Scripture did play a part, though clearly a subordinate one, in supporting the 
letter’s particular focus on christological, ecclesiological, and ethical concerns.—D.J.H.

Women in the Church of Philippi], DeltBibMel 9 (2, ’80) 77-85. 

To clear the way for a correct understanding of the role of women in the Pauline churches, 
one must recognize that 1 Cor 14:34-35 is an interpolation as C. K. Barrett and H. Conzelmann 
among others have argued. Lydia was obviously a prominent personality at Philippi 
(Acts 16:14-15). Two other women, Euodia and Syntyche, are mentioned as having labored in 
missionary work at Paul’s side together with Clement and other fellow workers (Phil 4:2-3). 
Paul’s exhortations to the community and to Euodia and Syntyche to be “of the same mind’’ 
and to “agree in the Lord’’ (Phil 2:2; 4:2) indicate that discord at Philippi found expression 
through these women, who apparently had leading roles in the Philippian church.—Th.S.

focuses on the issues of the unity of the epistle, the opponents envisaged by it, and the chris- 
tological hymn (Phil 2:6-11). Stylistic and thematic evidence confirms the epistle’s unity and 
renders improbable the hypothesis that it is comprised of two or three smaller epistles of Paul to 
the Philippians. The opponents in chap. 3 were “judaizing pseudo-apostles,” but those in 
1:15-17 cannot be certainly identified. The christological hymn, which is pre-Pauline, was freely 
adapted by Paul to his hortatory purposes.—Th.S.

In their respective epistles to the Philippians, Paul referred to “bishops (overseers) and 
deacons” (1:1) whereas Polycarp mentioned “presbyters and deacons” (5:3), an unusual schema 
for the postapostolic period. This could be explained by the supposition that the plural terms 
“bishops” and “presbyters” were interchangeable in the apostolic period but not in the post¬ 
apostolic period, when the singular term “bishop” prevailed. Polycarp’s failure to mention a 
“bishop” could indicate that this office, perhaps previously held by the fallen “presbyter” 
Valens, was now vacant at Philippi.—Th.S.

H. L. Strack and P. Billerbeck in their Kommentar zum Neuen Testament (4th ed., 1965) 
cited a number of christological texts that have as background Ps 110 (109, LXX) but did not 
include Phil 2:6-11. It is true that there are no direct terminological affinities between these two 
texts, and the schema of humiliation/exaltation is not evident in Ps 110. However, Ps 110:1 and 
Phil 2:6-11 share the theological topos of messianic exaltation. The exaltation (hypsosis) of 
Christ and his establishment as Lord in Phil 2:6-11 may well have as background the motif of 
enthronement and the use of the term “Lord” (kyrios) in Ps 110:1.—Th.S.

When the titles “Christ” and “Lord” in 1-2 Thessalonians are compared, it is observed that 
the title “Christ” looks to the past, remembering the passion and resurrection of Jesus, and the 
title “Lord” looks to the future. Paul had a particular perspective on the inscrutable mystery of 
Christ. In some of his later letters, e.g. the Captivity epistles, he speaks with great clarity of 
Jesus as Lord. For this reason some have denied the authenticity of the letters to the Thes¬ 
salonians. Examination of these letters, however, shows that at the beginning of his apostolic 
activity, Paul perceived and expressed the greatness of Jesus in the same way that he did in his 
later epistles.—M.P.H.

Exegetical discussion of skeuos in 1 Thes 4:4 has not taken account of the sexual connotation 
of the equivalent Hebrew term keli in 1 Sam 21:5 (21:6 in Hebrew). The phrase skeuos ktasthai

part of a positive statement of sexual abstinence applicable to both married and unmarried 
men.—D.J.H.

1 Tim 2:11-15 does not provide a solid basis for excluding women from positions of teaching 
or authority in the church. D. J. Moo’s interpretation of the passage [§ 25-604] suffers from 
exegetical and logical weaknesses that undermine his allegation that women are not suited to 
teach or to have authority over men. The situation at Ephesus was one in which women were 
involved in false teaching; this would have given the enemy an opportunity for slander if Paul 
had not restricted the teaching and authoritative activities of women. But Paul did not say that 
women should never teach or have authority over men, nor did he exclude women in his lists of 
requirements for being an overseer, elder, or deacon. [The same issue (pp. 198-222) contains

The passages cited by C. C. Kroeger do not support the sexual connotation that she suggests 
for the Greek term authentein. The few occurrences of the word in ancient Greek literature 
indicate that the meaning “exercise authority, dominate” was added, at least from the 1st 
century B.C., to the original meaning, “murder.” In 1 Tim 2:12 the context fully warrants the 
rendering of authentein as “domineer.” Paul’s admonition against domineering over the men of 
the congregation was directed toward some women in whom a gentle and quiet spirit had given 
way to an unhealthy assertiveness.—D.J.H.

The first two parts of this article concern the calculation of the regnal years of the 
Achaemenids and the OT references to the second year of Darius, respectively. The third part 
(pp. 28-41) argues that the designation “to the Hebrews’’ was a late (ca. A.D. 140) and arbitrary 
addition; it suggests that very early in the textual transmission the initial epistolary protocol of 
the epistle ceased to be copied.—D.J.H.

In teaching the priesthood of Christ, the author of Hebrews presented the Son of God as the 
transcendent high priest, mediator of the new covenant, chief pastor, and surpasser of the 
Jewish cult. He spoke about the leaders of the community (see 13:7, 10, 17) in a way that 
implied participation in the priesthood of Christ, the chief pastor.—D.J.H. 

1008. A. ViCENT Cernuda, “La introduccidn del Primogenito, segiin Hebr. 1,6,’’ EstBib 39 
(1-2, ’81) 107-153. 

A word-by-word examination of Heb 1:6 in light of the writings of Philo shows that the verse 
explains the incarnation euphemistically. A generative verb is avoided in order to point to the 
parthenogenetic character of the birth. “First-bom’’ means birth in a virginal way, as in Lk 2:7. 
The worship of angels emphasizes that the incarnation does not assume that the incarnate 
changes. The articulation in v. 5 is strongly adversative (“on the contrary’’) and thus opposes 
the historical incarnation to the preexistent divine generation.—M.P.H.

An exact translation of Heb 5:7-10 and a comparison of the passage with its Gospel parallels 
show that Jesus prayed not to be freed from suffering and death, but to be completely con¬ 
formed to the will of his Father. The etymology of eulabeia (“acceptance’’), which indicates 
why Jesus was heard (v. 7), and the context imply perfect agreement with God’s will.—J.J.C. 

1010. K. Grayston, “Salvation Proclaimed: III. Hebrews 9:11-14,’’ ExpTimes 93 (6, ’82) 
164-168. 

The somewhat elaborate and rhetorical clauses in Heb 9:11-14 are dependent on the affirma¬ 
tion in V. 12c (“he entered once for all into the Holy Place’’), which expresses the central 
imagery of the epistle. Verse 11 prepares for v. 12c; v. 13 expands v. 12a, as v. 14a-c expands 
V. 12b and v. 14de expands v. 12d. The blood of Jesus was understood to give protection against 
the dangers of drawing near to God by means of an analogy with the Jewish Temple cult. For the 
author of Hebrews, deliverance from awareness of sin and death was a necessary consequence 
of affirming both the blood of Christ and the eternal Spirit.—D.J.H.

The epistle of James uses four coordinates (kai, e, alia, de) within phrases to coordinate 
syntagmatic units, generally of the same nature and always having the same function. The 
coordinates de, gar, oun, mental and toinyn, and e and alia serve to link phrases together. 
Attention to the use of these coordinates can help solve linguistic, textual, and literary problems

After describing the methodology used in this investigation of the manuscripts of the epistle

The perspective of judgment allows the apparently disparate counsels given in Jas 5:7-20 to be 
grouped under the following headings: patience (vv. 7-11), the yes and the no (v. 12), prayer 
(vv. 13-18), and the duty of bringing back those who stray (vv. 19-20). The first two segments 
concern all the “brethren,” and the last two take account of the disparities introduced by 
sickness and sin.—D.J.H.

Reminiscent of Abraham and Moses, the Christians addressed by 1 Peter were strangers and 
sojourners undertaking a new exodus with the certitude of being accompanied by the God of 
covenant and promise. Their exodus led them into the heart of the world, for the condition of 
dispersion was essential to their calling, which was to present an authentic, positive, and 
convincing witness to unbelievers. The greater part of the article seeks the reason for the 
emphasis in 1 Peter on the community of Christians through a close reading and explication of 
the pericope in 2:4-10. This pericope functions decisively in the epistle by introducing the 
surrounding world (see vv. 7-8). Thereafter the problem of the Christian community’s finding its 
raison d’etre in the context of an uncomprehending and hostile world becomes central. Bound 
to Christ, the community is at once solid and mobile in its engagement with God and the world. 
Christ renders Christians analogous to himself, and Christians in return must render themselves 
analogous to Christ in imitation of his life on earth. The spiritual house that Christians are to be 
built into (see v. 5) is living and growing, and the community exists to proclaim the gospel to the 
world through verbal and nonverbal action (see vv. 5, 9).—E.G.B.

Although “gird your loins” is a familiar biblical command, “gird the loins of your mind”

that this entire section (1:13—2:10) reflects the account of the original Passover and exodus from

allusions to Isaiah 53, the prophetic portrait of the Suffering Servant.—D.J.H. 

1018. J. L. Houlden, “Salvation Proclaimed: II. 1 John l:5-2:6: Belief and Growth,” Exp

The two groups of three statements each in 1 Jn l:5-2:6 (beginning at 1:6, 8, 10; 2:4, 6, 9) 
testify to matters that were of direct consequence to the Johannine church. The author of the 
epistle saw the Christian life as involving both a status conferred and a continuing process of 
moral endeavor. What is most striking in his attitude is the combination of high claims and 
practicality: Sin is wholly anomalous m the life of the Christian; yet it is present, cannot be 
ignored, and must be removed.—D.J.H.

by 1 Jn 2:29-3:10, this structural analysis concludes that the passage is primarily concerned not 
with moral culpability but with deciding who is bom of God and who is the child of the devil. 
The statement “he cannot sin” in 1 Jn 3:9 means that those who so sin are bom not of God but 
of the devil. In conclusion, the article shows how stmctural analysis uses the positive results of 
other methods.—J.J.C.

A more profound understanding of NT writings can be achieved by studying them against the 
background of contemporaneous Jewish writings. In Jude 4 the impious, who were probably 
gnostics, are described as (1) destined for judgment, (2) perverting the grace of God to licen¬ 
tiousness, and (3) rejecting the one master and Lord, Jesus Christ. An examination of this triple 
characterization shows that the letter of Jude depends directly on / Enoch and Assumption of 
Moses, and indirectly on apocalyptic writings, the Dead Sea scrolls, the gnostic texts from Nag 
Hammadi, Targum Neofiti, and the works of Josephus.—M.P.H.

Revelation 


1021. M. D. Hooker, “Myth, Imagination and History,” EpworthRev 9 (1, ’82) 50-56. 

Myth expresses human experience of the world in terms that people can understand. The 
author of Revelation used old myths and symbols to clarify his message: In spite of all appear¬ 
ances to the contrary, God is in control.—D.J.H. 

1022. [Rev 2-3] M. Laconi, “Le lettere di Giovanni alle Chiese dell’Asia,” SacDoc 26 (96, ’81) 
149-172. 

In his Apocalisse prima e dopo (1980), E. Corsini makes some interesting suggestions about 
Revelation 2-3: (1) The dangers to the churches are not primarily from persecution, but from 
within. (2) The seven letters reflect various stages in salvation history. For example, the letter 
to the Ephesians represents the fall of Adam (see 2:7, 10), and the letter to the Laodiceans 
represents Judaism rejected (3:16) and the time of the Messiah (3:20).—^J.J.C.

Jean?” Antonianum 56 (2-3, ’81) 265-295. 

After examining the debate about the origin of the Passover Haggadah and suggesting that 
some of its traditions antedate A.D. 70, the article presents evidence for the existence of a 
Christian Passover Haggadah (e.g. 1 Cor 5:7-8; Melito’s Paschal Homily) featuring a chris- 
tological interpretation of the Passover symbols (especially the lamb) and hope for the 
Messiah’s return. The last part of the article calls attention to traces of the Christian Passover 
Haggadah in Revelation 4—5. Those chapters and the Palestinian version of the Jewish Passover 
Haggadah share several themes: the gift of the Law, the power of the King of Kings, the passage 
from tyranny to a kingdom of priests, the theme of the covenant, the new song, and the call to 
praise. Nevertheless, their theological atmospheres differ greatly.—D.J.H. 

1024. M. Morgen, “Apocalypse 12, un targum de I’Ancien Testament,” FoiVie 80 (6, ’81) 
63-74. 

The Targums of the Pentateuch can illuminate the ways in which the OT was used in the 
composition of Revelation 12. The first part of the article discusses the OT portrayals of the 
dragon-serpent (especially in Genesis 3) and the woman-Israel. The second part, which illus¬ 
trates how the targums clarify Revelation 12, focuses on the serpent in Genesis 3 and Exodus 7 
and on the association between the woman-Israel, nourishment, and the serpent.—D.J.H. 

1025. W. W. Reader, “The Twelve Jewels of Revelation 21:19-20: Tradition History and 
Modem Interpretations,” JournBibLit 100 (3, ’81) 433-457. 

The first part of this tradition history of the lists of twelve stones not only examines the OT 
lists (Exod 28:17-20; 39:10-13; Ezek 28:13) and their Hellenistic-Jewish translations (Septuagint, 
Philo, Josephus) but also investigates the hitherto largely ignored inventories in targumic and 
midrashic texts and in ps.-Philo’s Biblical Antiquities. The second part evaluates representative 
20th-century attempts at interpreting Rev 21:19-20, and the conclusion assesses the significance 
of the jewel catalogue in the vision of the new Jemsalem. The jewel motif in Revelation is 
closely related to the gem stories in Biblical Antiquities: The stones have theophanic, ecclesi- 
ological, protological, and eschatological significance.—D.J.H.

The duality involved in the description of Jesus as ho aster ho lampros ho proinos (“the

as Shar/!$alim at Ugarit, ‘Attar/Istar in ancient Mesopotamia, and Azizos/Monimos in Syria. 
This extrabiblical background is confirmed by the reference to the “water of life’’ in Rev 22:17

Bultmann set out to defend faith against the encroachments of scientific and secular historical 
thinking. He also aimed to give an account of the gospel and Christian faith that would do justice 
to the richness and variety of historical reality. But the end result of Bultmann’s project was a 
spectral, abstract, and ahistorical picture both of Christ and of the faith that relies on him. The 
fatal wrong step was taken when reality was divided ontologically into two spheres and faith 
was alienated from reason.—D.J.H. 

1028. H. D. Hummel, “Biblical or Dogmatic Theology?’’ ConcJourn 1 (5, ’81) 191-200. 

Neither biblical theology nor dogmatic theology can stand alone; the point is precisely their 
mutuality. The norma normans easily loses its center (Christ) and its objective authority with¬ 
out the hermeneutical entree and controls guaranteed by the confessions. On the other hand, 
the norma normata and the dogmatics built upon it easily become a dessicated traditionalism 
unless constantly renewed and enriched by Scripture.—D.J.H. 

1029. L. Newbigin, “Text and Context: The Bible in the Church,’’ NESTTheolRev 5 (1, ’82) 
5-13. 

This response to the reasons giver py J. Barr for the failure of the biblical-theological move¬ 
ment makes three major points: ^i) The dogmas underlying the modem scientific world view 
need to be brought under the “^cmtiny of the gospel. (2) To treat the cultural gap between the 
Bible and ourselves as unbridgeable is to deny the unity of humanity in the saving purpose of 
God. (3) Reading the Bibie as testimony of God’s unique and decisive revelation of himself in 
Jesus Christ is an integral part of Christian commitment.—D.J.H. 

1030. G. T. SiiEPPARD, “Canonization. Hearing the Voice of the Same God through His¬ 
torically Dissimilar Traditions,’’ Interpretation 36 (1, ’82) 21-33. 

Evidence for early holistic readings of the Hebrew Bible is provided by postexilic midrash, 
“canon-conscious” redactions of biblical books, and the thematizing of historically dissimilar 
traditions under the mbrics of Torah, Prophets, and Wisdom. The similarities between the 
canonical aspects of the OT and those of the NT can generate important insights about the 
theological task of stating the one gospel of Jesus Christ amid differing historical resources, the 
relation between the four Gospels and Paul’s letters, and the relation between religious plural¬ 
ism and the various magisteria. There are critical differences between the debate over biblical 
unity in the modem biblical-theology movement and the way the same issue was faced in 
postexilic Judaism and early Christianity.—D.J.H.

92-96.—Combining scholarly erudition and clarity of expression, Dunn shows good judgment 
and a sure touch in assessing the NT evidence. Yet the Johannine christological synthesis, 
which he regards as the work of an inspired genius, can also be interpreted as the squeezing of

1033. R. H. Fuller, “Pre-Existence Christology: Can We Dispense With It?’’ WordWorld 2

The common objections to the preexistence and incarnation Christology—mythological char¬ 
acter, no basis in Jesus’ self-understanding, absence from the earliest kerygma, shift in focus 
away from the death and resurrection, distortion of the real Jesus—are not convincing enough 
to warrant its abandonment. The raw materials of the doctrine of the Trinity lie in the historical 
life of Jesus as the Fourth Evangelist came to see it. The preexistence and incarnation Chris¬ 
tology is the foundation of the Christian understanding of God.—D.J.H. 

1034. H. Haag, “ ‘Son of God’ in the Language and Thinking of the Old Testament,’’ Con¬

This article discusses the Egyptian pharaoh as “true god and true man,’’ the OT Davidic king 
as “son of God,’’ sons of God at the heavenly court, Israel as the son of God, and the devout as 
the sons of God. It concludes that in the OT and early Judaism the title “son of God’’ signified 
creatureliness, election, and intimacy. It had no messianic connotation, and it was certainly not 
intended to signify divinity.—D.J.H. 

1035. H. Langkammer , “Tod und Auferstehung Jesu Christi im urchristlichen Kerygma,’’

The primitive Christian kerygma referred to the death and resurrection of Jesus in many 
ways. The various formulas mentioned accusation and raising up (e.g. Acts 2:23-24), faith (Rom 
10:9), the divine passive (1 Cor 15:3b-5), the sacrifice for {hyper) others (Rom 8:31-32; 
Mk 10:45), rescue from the dead (Rom 6:4), mediation of salvation (1 Thes 5:9-10), exaltation 
(Phil 2:6-11), and atoning sacrifice (Rom 3:25). The theological dimensions of the resurrection 
were expressed concisely but eloquently in Rom 1:3-4.—D.J.H.

rection confession of him as Son of God. According to Mark, though Jesus was closer to God 
than anyone else, there was tension and dissimilarity between the power (13:39), knowledge 
(13:32), and will (14:36) of the Father and the Son. The messianic and other OT meanings of 
“Son of God” retained some of their vitality in Mt and Lk. It is clear that, for Paul, Jesus did 
not become God’s Son only at his resurrection, and that Paul considered Jesus to be God’s Son 
in a wider sense than the messianic function allowed. The writings of John do not mention the 
Son’s origin or birth from the Father. The NT title “Son of God’’ is filled with the story of 
someone’s life, precisely the story that is expressed in the parable of the vineyard (Mk 12:1-12 
parr.).—D.J.H.

After discussing the presentation of Melchizedek in Gen 14:17-21, the article outlines the 
speculations about Melchizedek in Philo’s writings, 2 Enoch, and 1 IQMelch. Then it considers

the archaeological and literary evidence from antiquity about crucifixion, it defines docetism, 
comments on relevant NT and apocryphal texts, and calls attention to clearly docetic, possibly 
docetic, and antidocetic expressions in the Nag Hammadi corpus. Later developments are also 
considered.—D.J.H.

Taking its definition of the laity from Vatican II’s Lumen gentium 31, the article shows how 
the concept was developed in the OT (e.g. Exod 19:6; Ezekiel 37; Daniel 7; 12) and the NT. This 
new people is defined in the NT as the sheepfold of the Lord (Jn 10:11-16; Acts 20:28), the bride 
of Christ (Eph 5:25; Rev 19:7), and the people whom Christ has sanctified with his blood

progression from original unity, to regional or ideological diversity, and finally to universality. 
(2) Study of the Pauline house churches raises important questions about church structure, 
liturgy, and ethics. (3) The list of churches in the postapostolic period of the NT would include 
three forms of post-Pauline communities (Pastorals, Ephesians and Colossians, Lk-Acts), two 
forms of Johannine communities, a community related to 1 Peter, the Matthean community, and 
a community related to the epistle of James. (4) Modern biblical studies have much to contribute 
to our understanding of the church of Rome, complementing what has been learned from history 
and archaeology.—D.J.H.

1041. B. GArtner, “Didaskolos: The Office, Man and Woman in the New Testament, Cone 
Journ 8 (2, ’82) 52-60. 

Jesus deliberately limited the office of apostle to men. In the early church, men and women 
worked side by side “in the gospel,” completing each other; but their roles were not mixed. It is 
clear from the context that Paul’s teaching concerning women and church office in 1 Cor 14:34 
and 1 Tim 2:12 was normative. The principle of subordination must be understood against the 
background of the teaching of the church as the body of Christ.—D.J.H. 

1042. G. Keerankeri, “The Role of the Laity in the New Testament,” Vidyajyoti 45 (11, ’81)

The NT concept of the people of God as a community of believers provides the scriptural 
basis for a theology of the laity divested of all structural polarity with the clergy. After explain¬ 
ing the idea of the people of God in the OT and NT, the article treats the new people of God 
vis-a-vis the old, the role of the people of God, its priestly service and option for the poor, 
common priesthood and ministerial priesthood, and the role of the people of God and the 
theology of charisms.—D.J.H. 

1043. K. Kertelge, “Die eine Kirche Jesu Christi im Zeugnis des Neuen Testaments,” 
Catholica 35 (4, ’81) 265-279. 

According to the NT, the unity of the church is the expression of its abiding, vital connection 
with Jesus Christ. The church of Jesus Christ is the community of disciples, arises out of 
participation {koindnia) in Jesus, and has a universal dimension. Reflections on the present 
significance of the NT teaching on church unity conclude the article.—D.J.H.

Since the church, according to the NT, has its existence in and nature from Christ, its 
government is necessarily ministerial; charisms serve to build up the church. The final picture 
of the church’s governmental structure yielded by the NT consists of apostles or apostolic 
delegates, presbyter-bishops, and deacons, besides various other charisms (most of which 
probably merged with the last two offices).—D.J.H.

tion of the NT, and a number of theological interpretations. Two of his theological interpreta¬

Contemporary Marxist thinkers such as E. Bloch, M. Machovec, L. Kolakowski, and 
R. Garaudy seek to understand primitive Christianity more through the activity and teaching of 
Jesus than through the experience of the Jerusalem community. They are sensitive to the future 
dimension of the kingdom preached by Jesus, his teachings about nonviolence and mutual love, 
and the subversive force of Christian principles. Their paradigm of primitive Christianity is

146 (19, ’82) 374-379. 

Mary was portrayed as the first Christian by Luke, and as the mother of the ideal disciple by 
John, because she met the gospel criterion of discipleship. Both on the ecumenical level and in 
terms of popular devotion, the Scriptures’ view of Mary as a disciple is productive and loyal to 
the best traditions of Mariology.—D.J.H.

This examination of how some key biblical figures prepared themselves for their missions 
focuses on Moses, Isaiah and Jeremiah, Hosea, Jesus ben Sirach, the apostles formed in the 
school of Jesus, and Paul. What was decisive was the relationship with God by which the person 
became an effective agent, not the particular work outwardly accomplished (which depended on 
God’s will).—D.J.H. 

1050. O. L. Cope, “Ethics and the New Testament: A Survey of Perspectives 1970-1980,”

The fundamental issues in the study of NT ethics from 1970 to 1980 revolved around the prior 
perception of the role and authority of the Bible, and around one’s judgment of the conflict 
between a reward/punishment and a being loved/grateful response point of departure. The NT 
has been drawn into debates on issues such as the liberation of the oppressed, gay rights, 
abortion, and equal rights for women, which were not at center focus in its world.—D.J.H.

principles of NT eschatology, especially through their study of Paul’s epistles. They have 
insisted on the two extreme points at either end of the eschatological “line”: the resurrection 
and the return of Jesus. On this basis they have developed a whole theology of the so-called 
semi-eschatological period.—D.J.H. 

1053. C. Felder, “Racial Ambiguities in the Biblical Narratives,” Concilium 151 (’82) 17-24. 

Two processes related to racism appear to be operative in the biblical corpus: (1) sacraliza¬ 
tion, by which the OT writers construed salvation history in terms distinctly favorable to Israel 
as opposed to other nations; and (2) secularization, by which the NT authors lost sight of the 
vision of universalism, marginalized the darker races outside the Roman empire, and set the 
stage for a Europe-centered church.—D.J.H.

E. and F. Stagg, Woman in the World of Jesus (1978); and S. T. Foh, Women and the Word of

legal term with reference to the buying back of a forfeited life through material compensation 
(Exod 21:30; Num 35:31-32; Exod 30:12), and illegally accepted ransom (Amos 5:12; 1 Sam 
12:3; Prov 6:35). The second part discusses kdper as a theological term: the redemption of Israel 
through Yahweh (Isa 43:3-4), the ransom found by the angelic intercessor (Job 33:24; 36:18), 
and the denial of human self-redemption (Ps 49:7-8). The third part concerns the Son of Man’s

the “federalist” interpretation of the continuity and discontinuity between the old and new 
covenants. The OT teaching on justification does not bring clearly into view the idea of imputed

righteousness as the sole ground of human salvation. The NT teaching clarifies the constitutive 
and demonstrative aspects of forensic, “soteric” justification. There is no contradiction be¬ 
tween Paul’s teaching and the teachings of James and the author of Hebrews on this matter. The 
biblical doctrine of justification takes into account the imputation of Christ’s righteousness as 
the sole meritorious ground of salvation, and works as evidential of saving faith.—D.J.H.

The biblical teaching of subjection and obedience is an authoritative guide to all relationships, 
not merely to the marriage bond. After discussing the NT uses of hypotassesthai and hypotage, 
the article considers three objections to the submission of wives to their husbands, and applies 
the whole of Eph 5:21-6:9 to the problem.—D.J.H. 

1061. J. Kremer, “Der Frieden—eine Gabe Gottes. Bibeltheologische Erwagungen,’’ Stimm 
Zeit 107 (3, ’82) 161-173. 

The concept of peace occurs in the OT as a word of salutation (Num 6:26), as the antithesis of 
war (Jer 6:14), and as the antithesis of evil (Isa 45:6-7). The peace (or salvation) expected by the 
prophets of Israel to result from divine creativity was the peace Jesus announced as the already 
present kingdom of God. Jesus went to his death without giving up hope in the ultimate 
realization of this salvation. After Jesus’ death and resurrection, the early church preached that 
God through Jesus had fulfilled the old covenant not in the form of an earthly kingdom of Israel 
but as salvation for all humanity, i.e. their deliverance from sin and death and their reception 
into the life and spirit of God; God’s new act of creation would find completion, after a period of 
great affliction, at the parousia. Jesus commanded his disciples to act so as to communicate his 
peace to the world. Likewise the early church believed that the baptized, through their com¬ 
munion with the resurrected Jesus, were enabled and empowered to actualize peace. Three 
consequences of this analysis are elaborated with respect to the contemporary quest for 
peace.—E.G.B.

Only in the 1890s did the question of the fundamental significance of eschatology for early 
Christian thought become a central issue in NT scholarship. The development of NT eschatol¬ 
ogy was explained in diverse ways by C. H. Dodd, A. Schweitzer, and H. D. Wendland; each 
interpretation continues to attract supporters. In approaching early Christian eschatology, it is 
necessary to disentangle the historian’s task from current attitudes, to determine at what points 
in NT eschatology a consensus can be obtained, and to establish one’s own position on exeget- 
ical grounds.—D.J.H.

lytical model developed by A. J. Greimas, the semiotic square), the article reviews the semiotic 
analyses of Lk 1-2 (by the Groupe de Lyon, A. Gueuret, B. Rosaz), Jn 2:1-12 (P. Geoltran), and 
Revelation 12 (J. Calloud), and offers semiotic observations on Mt 1-2, Jn 19:25-27, and Revela¬ 
tion 12. The semiotic approach allows us to situate better the place and function of Mary in 
these texts and to clarify the dynamism of the Marian symbolism. But the approach runs the 
risks of subordinating the texts to the tool of research and transforming the hypotheses of the 
method into a philosophical system.—D.J.H. 

1064. L. Monloubou, “Modemite de la femme biblique,” BullLitEccl 82 (4, ’81) 243-262. 

The portrayal of women in the Bible has something to say to our modem world. It is not the 
social situation of women in the biblical world that is most significant, but rather their place in 
the mythopoetic interpretation of the world and human existence as formulated by people in 
biblical times. It is at this deep level that the modem aspects of the biblical representation of 
women must be investigated.—D.J.H.

After providing statistics on the term loudaios in the NT, the article considers the attitudes

Paul’s letters. It gives particular attention to the historical setting of the so-called anti-Jewish 
statements in the gradual separation of the church from Judaism, and concludes by recalling 
Paul’s understanding of the church as “sharing in the root of the rich olive tree” (Rom 11:17).—

The theme of death and life as it appears in the NT is discussed under these headings: the use 
of terms for death and life; the relation between sin and death; Sheol, Hades, and sepulcher; 
death as the enemy of God; life after death; and the triumph of life over death as the end of 
history.—D.J.H.

Bulletin [Gettysburg, PA] 62 (1, ’82) 17-33. 

Since much of modem exegesis has mptured the link between the Last Supper of Jesus and 
the Lord’s Supper of Christ’s church, there has emerged a great gulf that did not exist for 
Luther when he wrote about the Abendmahl. A. Schweitzer’s attempt at linking the two meals 
through an eschatological Jesus as depicted in Mk failed to carry the day. Among the areas of 
relative consensus in recent scholarship are (1) the lesser importance of Jesus’ words in the 
upper room compared with the eschatological impulse, (2) the likelihood that other meals in 
Jesus’ ministry played a background role, and (3) the possible role of post-Easter meals of the 
disciples together and with the risen Lord. For setting the themes and limits of our Lord’s 
Suppers today, we need an awareness of both the historical Jesus and post-Easter develop¬ 
ments. [The same issue (pp. 33-39) contains Reumann’s responses to questions arising from the

of his day, rejecting them as insignificant in comparison with the all-important requirements of 
repentance and faith. Paul fought for and enlarged the revolution initiated by Jesus. The early 
Christian communities defined their own boundaries as they faced the questions of what beliefs 
were essential to Christian faith and what conduct merited exclusion from the community. 
During the century after the fall of Jerusalem in A.D. 70, the chief stimulus to think through 
these questions came from the gnostic movement.—D.J.H.

As background for understanding the Holy Spirit in the NT, three OT themes are studied 
here: the glory of Yahweh, God’s countenance and light, and God’s power and the anthro¬ 
pomorphisms (e.g. arm, hand, right hand, finger of God) by which it is expressed. The NT 
makes explicit what is implicit in the OT—that the Spirit is the glory of God, the warmth and 
light offered to human beings through life in the divine countenance that is Christ, the fullness of 
divine power, and the unique finger of God. Rather than using anthropomorphisms, the NT 
usually speaks of the dynamis of God or of Christ.—J.J.C. 

1070. G. Strecker, “Homosexualitat in biblischer Sicht,’’ KerDog 28 (2, ’82) 127-141. 

Homosexuality, which was widespread in the ancient world, was strictly forbidden by the OT 
(see Lev 18:22; 20:13) and the NT (see Rom 1:26-27; 1 Cor 6:9-10; 1 Tim 1:10). Homosexual 
activity was looked upon as characteristic of pagan immorality. Though overcome by baptism 
(see 1 Cor 6:11), it was still a problem in the NT communities and was attacked as such. Today 
the biblical prohibition of homosexuality should not be repeated legalistically, but rather con¬ 
sidered in view of God’s judgment and grace. The question whether homosexual persons may 
fill pastoral or educational positions should be answered within the context of agape and 
righteousness.—D.J.H.

The debate about early Catholicism has both theological-confessional and historical dimen¬ 
sions; it raises questions about what is authentically Christian and the church’s fidelity to the 
gospel. Nevertheless, since the term “early Catholicism’’ is so unclear and open to so many 
misunderstandings, it would be better to substitute “early church’’ to signify the period from 
Easter to A.D. 324. The problems connected with early Catholicism (acceptance of the OT, 
liturgy, ministry, tradition and succession, canon, etc.) should be studied on their own merits.—

A treatment of the ideal of the indissolubility of marriage and the practice of divorce in the 
OT, with attention to the interpretation of Deuteronomy 24, and an examination of Judaism 
contemporary with Jesus (the controversy between the Shammaites and the Hillelites about 
conditions for divorce, the attitude of Damascus Document and 1 IQTemple) lead to the ques¬ 
tion of divorce in the NT. The texts (Mt 5:32; Lk 16:8; Lk 10:11-12; Mt 19:9; Mk 10:2-9; 
Mt 19:3-8; and 1 Cor 7:10) attribute to Jesus a radical prohibition of divorce, although Matthew 
allowed divorce in the case of porneia (which probably refers to incest). Discussions of the

the Latin church, the interpretation by the Eastern church of the Matthean exception as per¬ 
mitting divorce in the case of adultery, and dissolution of the matrimonial bond in favoremfidei 
with its successive amplifications suggest that, if Matthew could admit the possibility of divorce 
in the case of porneia for the Christians of his community on social-religious grounds, the 
church today could admit divorce in special cases while maintaining in principle the indissolu¬ 
bility of Christian marriage.—M.P.H.

In the OT, God seized the initiative in the dialogue of love with his people. The “new 
commandment” in the NT refers to the climax and culmination of this dialogue in and through 
Jesus, the definitive revealer and mediator of salvation. The article discusses what Jesus dis¬ 
closed in his public activity about the loving God and the love demanded from human beings, 
why Jesus’ expiatory death on the cross was the crowning act of God’s love, and how human 
beings can respond to God’s love in the power of the Spirit.—D.J.H.

The close relation between theology and praxis is first explored in three pre-Gospel traditions 
(the pre-Markan passion account; the pre-Markan composition preserved in Mk 10:2-31, 35-45; 
the sayings source Q) and in three Gospel passages (the third passion prediction in Mk 10:32-34, 
the Sermon on the Mount in Mt 5-7, the parable of the merciful Samaritan in Lk 10:25-37). Then 
this relation is examined in the Pauline letters generally and in three specific passages (1 Cor 
15:3-5; Phil 2:6-11; Rom 6:1-14). The NT writers understood the proclamation of Jesus Christ 
both as arousing and strengthening faith, and as summoning people to shape their lives accord¬ 
ing to it.—D.J.H.

Taking as its starting point E. Nardi’s Procurato aborto net mondo greco romano (1971), the 
article surveys references to abortion in ancient Near Eastern, Greek, Roman, Jewish, and 
Christian writings up to Dante. Abortion is mentioned once in the OT (Exod 21:22-23) and not at 
all in the NT. Neither the Greek law codes nor the Roman law codes of the republic and the 
early empire made abortion an offense punishable by law.—D.J.H.

The evidence presently available, at least for the Roman Diaspora, is far from convincing 
proof for the existence of the “God-fearers” as a class of Gentiles attracted to Judaism. 
Excavations of the Jewish synagogues at Dura Europos, Sardis, Priene, Delos, Stobi, and Ostia 
have not yielded any inscriptions using the terms phoboiimenos or sebomenos to describe 
interested but unconverted Gentiles. Since Luke used those terms symbolically to show how 
Christianity became a Gentile religion legitimately and without losing its OT roots. Acts cannot 
be cited as proof that there ever were such people in the synagogues of the Roman empire. The

The portrayal of the Angel of the Lord and the Spirit of God as a pair of superior angels in 
Elchasaite traditions and in Ascension of Isaiah was related at one stage to a Jewish tradition, 
reported by Origen, that identified the two figures with the two cherubim of the ark of the 
covenant. These ideas arose from Second Temple Jewish reflections on the roles of the two 
figures with reference to the problem of anthropomorphism. Certain esoteric traditions about 
the cherubim in the writings of Philo and Josephus responded to the same problem. Acts 23:8 
(“no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit”) preserves a trace of the motif—D.J.H.

Recent excavations of the Cardo Maximus in the Old City of Jerusalem, directed by 
N. Avigad, have proved that the street was built in the Byzantine rather than the Roman period. 
The primary evidence for this dating is the large quantity of Byzantine pottery found under the 
paving. It was also observed that the Cardo was built according to the Byzantine foot of 32 cm., 
not the Roman foot of 29.6 cm.—E.G.B.

The synagogues at Masada and Herodium were built according to the same architectural 
scale, using the same foot and module. Moreover, both halls had the same width of thirty-six 
Roman feet. It is therefore evident that in Judea standard modular patterns were applied in 
addition to Vitruvius’ rules for proportioning atriums. Roman principles of architectural design 
were still applied in planning synagogues in Galilee centuries later.—D.J.H.

Among the objects found in a cave at Lajjun were three fragments of a cast bronze patera. 
Though rim and base no longer connect, enough remains of the curved wall of this rather 
shallow vessel to permit a reconstruction. Beyond the ring molding at the end of the handle 
appears the bearded face of Pan, with goat’s ears and horizontally spreading horns. It seems 
reasonable to assume that the patera was originally owned by a Roman officer who had been 
transferred from an earlier post in the West to the Legio VI Ferrata at a date after ca. A.D. 130 
and considerably earlier than the object’s final disposal in the 3rd century A.D.—D.J.H. 

1090. G. Schmitt, “Die dritte Mauer Jerusalems,’’ ZeitDeutschPalVer 97 (2, ’8i) 153-170, 
plates 11-12. 

The aim of the article is to confirm the identification of the north wall in Jerusalem, excavated 
by E. L. Sukenik and L. A. Mayer in 1925-27, with the “third wall.’’ The most serious challenge 
to this identification is the evidence from J. B. Hennessy’s excavations in 1964-66, dating the 
wall on the line of the Damascus Gate to the time of Agrippa I. However, M. Avi-Yonah’s 
association of Hennessy’s findings with the “second wall’’ [see § 13-1066], Josephus’ testimony 
(especially Ant. 19:326) indicating that Agrippa I built a major wall distinct from the third wall, 
and Y. Blomme’s redating of the Ecce Homo arch [see § 25-294] all favor the identification 
proposed by Sukenik and Mayer. After a closer examination of the evidence uncovered by the 
original excavators, the article goes on to refute seven more arguments against their identifica¬ 
tion. In particular it points out that the north wall’s uneven construction could be attributed to 
Agrippa I’s lack of sufficient funds; needing to “cut comers,’’ the builders chose the founda¬ 
tions as the least visible place to do so. Furthermore, K. M. Kenyon’s post-A.D. 59 dating of 
the w'all on the basis of two coins does not conflict with Sukenik and Mayer’s position that the 
wall was not built in its entirety by Agrippa I. The last section of the article scmtinizes the 
alternative theories of L. H. Vincent, K. M. Kenyon, P. Benoit, and E. W. Hamrick [see 
§§ 22-593; 25-1080]. It concludes that there is no decisive objection or convincing alternative to 
the identification of the north wall with the third wall.—E.G.B.

The earliest of the five books making up 1 Enoch, identified by J. T. Milik as the Astro¬ 
nomical Book (chaps. 72-82) and the Book of Watchers (chaps. 1-36), belong to the formative 
period of the Essene tradition and can be dated between 251 and 200 B.C. The calendar of 
/ Enoch, with its fixed solar year of 364 days, is not reflected in the OT but rather reflects a 
knowledge of the OT on the part of some later thinker. The calendar must have been devised at 
the very beginning of the pre-Essene movement, about 251 B.C., since the authors of the

Astronomical Book and the Book of Watchers had already discovered that the 364-day calendar 
did not entirely agree with the seasons. Nine concerns of a legal, spiritual, or apocalyptic nature 
(calendar. Jubilee year. Sabbath rest, predestination, belief in angels, eschatology, magic,

A survey of past scholarship on IQH and a reassessment of the Qumran community’s view of 
itself in relation to the rest of the world leads to these conclusions: The Hodayot are not 
dominated by any one literary form, but include thanksgiving, lament, hymn, praise, and 
meditative reflection. Although scholarly consensus favors the theory that one author com¬ 
posed IQH, this claim does not stand up under scrutiny. IQH is a varied collection of rhythmic 
prose authored by different people at different times; none of the IQH material demands 
authorship by the Teacher of Righteousness. Some of the psalms may originally have been 
created by cultic personnel for communal worship, and some may have been private composi¬ 
tions that were taken up for public use. Whereas IQS gives an objective, doctrinal presentation 
of dualism, predestination, human freedom, and divine sovereignty, IQH reflects the practical * 
working out of these ideas on a personal level. The “I” of IQH represents the Israelite who has 
been preordained for righteousness and has freely accepted and responded to the divine revela¬ 
tion necessary for salvation. The revelation is to be imparted to others, i.e. to the “poor”— 
those outside the community who need to be awakened to their destiny. The sect-outsider 
relationship takes on new meaning, and ideas of rigid exclusivism are to be rejected.—M.P.H. '

During the past thirty years, research on the Dead Sea scrolls has concentrated on archae- ,

Nevertheless, they have shed light on the christological titles “Lord” and “Son of God,” the

advanced in his introduction. The article focuses on the complex of problems centering around 
the Book of Parables and the newly isolated Book of Giants, and on the remarkably early dates 
posited for the Book of Watchers and the Astronomical Book. (1) There is insufficient warrant 
for assuming that the Qumran Enoch books were five in number. Even though the Book of 
Parables was most likely not part of the Qumran library, it appears to have been written by a 
Jewish author in a Semitic language in the 1st century A.D. (2) The Book of Watchers and the 
Astronomical Book were composed at a very early date (at least the 3rd century B.C.), but no 
firm terminus a quo has yet been established for either.—D.J.H.

Damascus Document 4:10b-12a should be seen as the conclusion of a longer literary unit 
beginning in 3:18b and centering around the midrashic interpretation of Ezek 44:15 and 1 Sam 
2:35. Both biblical texts announce a new priestly line. The Qumran interpretation of these texts 
was that the situation of the community resembled that of the Zadokites in Ezek 44:15. Others 
could join the community (CD 4:3, 7) until the period of evil was completed. After this deadline 
the opportunity to join the sect would be denied, and it would be as if a wall had been built 
between the sect and the rest of humanity. There is no reason to suspect that the passage 
equated the sectarian community with the (or a) temple, as some have suggested. Damascus 
Document's representation of dualism and predestination differs from that in IQS. In IQS 
predestination controls or replaces the individual’s conscience; in CD it controls only the 
framework of human history, the succession of the epochs.—M.P.H.

This examination of the Qumran fragment of Hos l:7-2:5 (4QXII‘^) provides a paleographic 
analysis, a transcription (with notes), and a reconstruction (with notes). The script seems to 
date from the Hasmonean period, early in the 1st century B.C. The text of the fragment agrees 
with the Masoretic text, and diverges from the Septuagint at only one point; we cannot decide 
about the Hebrew textual traditions of Hosea on this slim basis.—D.J.H.

The use of the accusative and the use of the prepositions 'hry, 7, 7, b, btwk, I, Ingd, Ipny,

phrase constructions used in IQS with meanings different from those in the OT or in rabbinic 
literature. In IQS the prepositional phrase is generally subordinated to a verb, very seldom to a 
substantive. The use of prepositions in IQS frequently corresponds to that in the early and 
middle books of the OT.—M.P.H.

The study of biblical manuscripts from the Dead Sea scrolls has focused attention on the 
question of whether the MT or the Septuagint (LXX) and its Vorlage (Old Septuagint, 4QSam^, 
Lucianic recension of LXX, Chronicles, Josephus, Old Latin) represents the better textual 
tradition. Involved in the discussion are not only details of textual transmission but also prob¬ 
lems of differing literary traditions. The analysis must include both literary criticism and textual 
criticism. Examination of 2 Sam 8:8 (LXX) in connection with 1 Kgs 2:35e (LXX) and 2 Sam 
5:4-5 shows that the variants of the LXX, less obvious in Samuel than in Kings, point to both a 
plurality of literary traditions and a different textual order. These two examples bring up further 
questions: (1) Vorlage versus targum—the evidence favors the position that the LXX of 1 Kgs 
2:35e is a translation of a Hebrew original rather than a “free composition” by the Greek 
translator. (2) History or midrash—the Palestinian text type reflected in 4QSam^, the LXX, and 
Chronicles is an authentic biblical text preserving valid historical elements.—M.P.H.

“Galileans” seems more likely not only in Lk 13:1-2 but also in Josephus’ Life 30, 62, 77-79, 
205-207. The other references in Life to Galileans afford no evidence whatsoever that the term 
denoted a distinct revolutionary party like the Zealots or the Sicarii. [In the same issue

The many rabbinic passages about God’s participation in Israel’s suffering and God’s sorrow 
over the destruction of the Temple are to be understood as a reaction against the Christian 
assertion that God had broken off his covenant with the historical people of Israel and trans¬ 
ferred it to the church. These themes found expression especially in the time of Aqiba (i.e. 
during the Hadrianic persecutions and their aftermath) and from the first half of the 3rd century 
A.D. until the mid-4th century A.D. (i.e. during the conflicts of the Palestinian Amoraim with 
opponents of Judaism).—D.J.H. 

1106. D. S. Barrett, “‘One-Up’ Anecdotes in Jewish Literature of the Hellenistic-Roman 
Era,” Prudentia [Auckland] 13 (2, ’81) 119-126. 

The “one-up” anecdotes in rabbinic literature fall into five categories: (1) A Greek or a 
Roman, without any provocation, is tricked, rebuked, or otherwise humiliated in some minor 
way. (2) A Greek or a Roman, attempting to argue with, insult, or otherwise humiliate a Jew, is 
defeated verbally. (3) A Greek or a Roman experiences humiliation (nonverbal), confusion, 
fear, physical discomfort, or injury at the hands of a Jew. (4) Hostile behavior by a Greek or a 
Roman toward a Jew is punished by death. (5) A Jew is preserved from his opponent’s clutches 
by a miracle, and the opponent often repents or makes amends. Most of the “one-up” 
anecdotes, at least in their details, are at variance with historical reality. Yet they are important 
to the social historian, for they form an indispensable part of ancient Jewish folklore.—D.J.H.

Analysis of the rabbinic stories concerning Rabbi Judah I leads to the following conclusions: 
(1) Opponents and supporters of his rule told stories in ways that reflected their political 
convictions. (2) We cannot always determine the historical realities behind the conflicting 
accounts. Where we can, it is clear that neither side had a monopoly on truth or falsehood. 
(3) Since the issues under debate remained alive for some time, it is difficult to be certain when 
the stories were told and retold in the form in which they have survived. (4) The issues that were 
disputed are clearly revealed in the conflicting stories. (5) The tactics employed by both sides 
(e.g. the use of miracle stories) can be determined and analyzed. (6) Rabbi Judah I showed great 
political finesse in his use of the opinions of opponents to keep the overall level of opposition 
lower. The skill he displayed in dealing with opponents helps explain his success as a leader.—

ma'al, the violation of items dedicated to the Temple or other sacred things, to reciting bless¬ 
ings before eating food. The effect of the blessing was to release the food from the status of 
divine property. This teaching was addressed to Jews who wondered whether the loss of the 
Temple and of Jerusalem prevented them from making use of produce. The separation ofma'al 
from the Temple and its further extension to all creation can be seen in b. Ber. 35ab. An 
appendix on agricultural dues and holy things after A.D. 70 concludes the article.—D.J.H.

Homily,” JewQuartRev 72 (1, ’81) 18-31. 

The compiler of the homily on Lev 2:1-2 in parashah 3 of Leviticus Rabbah spiritualized the 
notion of the poor person’s meal offering as self-sacrifice and self-affliction through prayer, 
repentance, and righteous acts. Thus he presented a uniform theme that was built up throughout 
the homily: Individual atonement and ultimate redemption depend on the willingness of Jews to 
give totally of themselves from the depth of their being. This analysis generally bears out 
J. Heinemann’s theory of the literary homily and the creative editorial process behind it 
[§ 16-378].—D.J.H. 

1110. S. J. D. Cohen, “Epigraphical Rabbis,” JewQuartRev 72 (1, ’81) 1-17. 

Examination of forty-eight inscriptions in which someone is called “rabbi” reveals that for 
centuries the term remained a popular title to describe individuals who were not part of the 
Hebrew- and Aramaic-speaking society that produced the Talmud. In other words, in antiquity 
not all rabbis were Rabbis. The synagogues in Israel and the Diaspora were not led by men titled 
“rabbi”; the “rabbinic” presence in the Diaspora was meager.—D.J.H. 

nil. J. J. Collins, “The Apocalyptic Technique: Setting and Function in the Book of 
Watchers,” CathBibQuart 44 (1, ’82) 91-111. 

The setting in life of the Book of Watchers (7 Enoch 1-36) cannot be specified with any 
historical precision, for its allegorical language is such that it could be applied to various 
situations. The function of the book was to console the righteous, to intimidate sinners, and to 
encourage the righteous to be faithful to the law of God. But the specific message was left rather 
vague. Through mythological allegory and celestial geography, the Book of Watchers trans¬ 
posed the frame of reference from the historical crisis to the transcendent world. Even though 
the apocalyptic vision did not have a publicly discernible effect on the historical crisis, it did 
provide a resolution in the imagination by evoking a sense of awe and instilling conviction in the 
revealed knowledge it imparted.—D.J.H. 

1112. O. Edwards, “Herodian Chronology,” PalExplQuart 114 (1, ’82) 29-42. 

Josephus in War was mistaken in his handling of the calendars of the Herodian period. He 
dated all the Herods’ reigns from the spring new year according to the ecclesiastical calendar, 
whereas the earlier Herods (excluding Agrippa II) dated their coins from the autumn civil new 
year’s day preceding accession. Thus he dated Herod the Great’s accession six months too 
early and Herod’s successors’ accession also six months too early in War and an additional 
twelve months too early in Antiquities. Therefore, the impression of coregencies from 4 to 1 
B.C. is an illusion created by the interplay of the two calendars. Josephus’ use of the ecclesias¬ 
tical calendar may have been part of his effort to play down the political dimension of the Jewish 
state and to stress its spiritual character.—D.J.H.

In Targum ps.-Jonathan of Genesis 3 and in related haggadic traditions, Adam is a typical 
figure, a historical person, the first father, and a creature. The fault of the woman is both 
figurative (eating forbidden fruit) and abstract (transgressing the human limits fixed by God). 
The serpent, a cunningly evil creature, is the angel of death in disguise. The targumic account

In Lives of the Prophets the Greek word teras, especially when joined with didonai, means 
“prediction” or “prophecy” rather than “sign.” This semantic shift had its origin in the

The birkat hdmminim as reformulated under Rabban Gamaliel II was primarily antiheretical 
rather than anti-Roman in intention. Members of the “sect of the Nazarenes” (see Acts 24:5) 
were prominent among those envisaged in its condemnatory clauses, and its impact was felt not 
only within the Jewish community but also among Gentile sympathizers. These claims are 
supported by a review of three important areas of study: early patristic complaints about the 
Jewish cursing of Christians together with other allegations about the synagogue and later 
Christian discussion of the benediction, the understanding of the benediction in Jewish liturgy 
and tradition, and the interaction between Judaism and nascent Christianity. The benediction of 
the minim was not decisive on its own for the separation of church and synagogue, but it did 
give solemn liturgical expression to a separation effected in the second half of the 1st century 
A.D. through the larger group of measures to which it belonged.—D.J.H.

Until quite recently the study of early rabbinic ideas and values took place within and was 
subject to hermeneutical categories borrowed mainly from 19th-century Protestant theology. 
Future work on rabbinic ethics must begin by analyzing the individual documents and unravel¬ 
ing their particular systems of thought. Only then can ethical data be abstracted and viewed 
against their systemic contexts. What may emerge is the identification of different ethical 
streams within early rabbinism.—D.J.H.

In Ant. 13:171-173 Josephus singled out their attitudes toward heimarmene as the issue that 
distinguished the Pharisees, the Essenes, and the Sadducees. Whatever influence Stoicism 
may have had, Josephus seems to have adopted heimarmene from the terminology of popular 
Hellenistic astrology to denote the determined governance of the human condition. He pre¬ 
sented the Jews as the people who were freed from heimarmene by the providence of God, and 
who consequently exercised free will and human responsibility in and through their obedience 
to the Torah.—D.J.H.

/ Enoch 12-16, which originated in the late 3rd or early 2nd century B.C., provided in 
Enoch’s heavenly vision (14:8-22) an important transitional point between prophetic traditions 
(see Ezekiel 1-2; 40-48) and later developments in Jewish mysticism. These chapters consti¬ 
tuted a tradition of northern Galilean provenance that reflected visionary activity in the area of 
Dan and Mount Hermon by people who viewed the Jerusalem Temple as defiled and therefore 
under the irrevocable judgment of God. Testament of Levi 2-7 located a visionary ascent to the 
heavenly temple in the same geographical area. The geographical setting of Peter’s commis¬ 
sioning in Mt 16:13-19, its formal similarities to epiphanic commissionings, and some of its ^

The documentation presented in Josephus’ Antiquities on the place of the Jews in Roman law ; 
occurs in four major blocks: the dossier on the consul L. Lentulus and his lieutenants at the 
beginning of the civil war (14:228-240), the decisions taken by Julius Caesar or at his instigation 
(14:190-212, 217-222, 241-246), a small group of documents from the period of the triumvirate 
(14:223-227, 262-264, 306-323), and the legislation about the Jews in Asia Minor and Cyrene i 
issued by Augustus and his collaborators (16:160-173). Other relevant material appears in 
Ant. 14:213-216, 256-258, 259-261. These decisions do not correspond to an orientation fixed in 
advance, but rather reflect the customary pragmatism of the Romans. Nevertheless, in seeking | 
to assure the political loyalty of Palestine, the Romans conferred on the Jewish communities of I

It cannot be proved that the practice of Jewish proselyte baptism existed in pre-Christian

A.D. The supposed connections between Jewish proselyte baptism and John’s baptism (and 
Christian baptism) in matters of terminology, ritual, catechetical instruction, and theology are 
not persuasive. A more suitable antecedent for John’s baptismal practice is the initiation rite at 
Qumran coupled with the increased eschatological tension in John’s perspective. There is little

preservation of 4 Ezra and other apocalypses. From scribe of the Torah of Moses to scribe of 
the wisdom of the Most High to prophet to revealer of magical-astrological secrets, the figure of 
Ezra continually took on new contours and nuances. Of all the subjects associated with

Temple implied acceptance of God’s justice and offered an explanation in keeping with it, e.g. 
just punishment for Israel’s wickedness, the exhibition of God’s righteousness, preparation for 
the future restoration in glory. But the author of 4 Ezra questioned the very axiom of God’s 
justice in permitting the Romans to wreak their will on Mount Zion. Only the experience of the

30:12, 21; 50:6, 13). This situation probably resulted when the Greek translator of Jubilees 
neglected to express the difference in meaning between the qal (“he wrote”) and hiphil (“he 
caused to write, dictated”) forms of ktb in 1:27; 30:21; 50:6, 13. The consistent picture in the

insights into the position of Roman aristocratic women in the early 2nd century A.D. Pliny’s 
own attitudes toward these women also become evident. Assuming his reliability and sincerity, 
Pliny s letters form a pleasant picture of the upper-class Roman women of this era in contrast to 
the unflattering portraits drawn by such contemporaries as Juvenal and Tacitus. The women 
Pliny writes of were devoted wives and family members. He depicts them as morally and 
intellectually equal to men and capable of the same heroism. His letters show that there was 
indeed warmth and love, not only in Roman marriages, but also in friendships between men and 
women.—E.G.B.

Stud 9 (1, ’81) 28-34. 

The language of the last book of Cicero’s Republic (known as the Dream of Scipio) shares 
more with the apocalypse genre than with the classical nekyia-imdxiion. In it there is a revela¬ 
tion given by the gods through a mediator to a seer concerning future events. The hero’s vision 
occurs while he is sleeping. He responds with the usual dread and is consoled by a heavenly 
being, who then shows him the heavens and explains human destiny in the hereafter, especially 
the rewards awaiting the righteous. Like other apocalyptic write'rs, Cicero was offering solace 
to the persecuted by affirming that the rewards and punishments of this world are transient in 
view of the next. The Dream of Scipio exemplifies the evolution of the nekyia into protest 
literature, much as prophecy evolved into apocalyptic.—E.G.B.

In asserting that the exposure of children was of negligible importance in the Greek and 
Roman worlds, D. Engels [§ 24-986] relied on a fallacious demographic argument about what 
was “impossible.” Apart from the inescapable reference to Polybius 36.17, he completely 
ignored the ancient texts concerning child exposure. He also ignored a great amount of com¬ 
parative information that has been collected by anthropologists and historians.—D.J.H.

The main narrative and the stories attached to it combine to form the world of the Golden 
Ass, a world of small Greek towns and villages that is not at all isolated from the wider context 
of the Roman empire in the 2nd century A.D. Apuleius clothes his sequence of fantastic 
episodes in a mass of vivid, concrete, and realistic detail expended on physical objects, houses, 
social structure, economic relations, the political framework of the local communities, and the 
wider framework of the empire. Apuleius’ representations can be seen in three ways: as por¬ 
traying areas of social life that ancient literature usually passes over, as adding color to patterns 
already known from other evidence, and as offering alternative models of society to those we 
normally accept. The images gained from the novel can be used to apply new questions and new 
hypotheses to the bewildering mass of data that survives from the real world of the Roman 
empire.—E.G.B.

maintained by almost all pre-Socratic scholars. (2) There are, however, good grounds for 
interpreting Heraclitus’ Logos as “Word,” understood as an inspired and prophetic word and 
viewed in immediate relation to Heraclitus’ doctrine of a cosmic and metaphysical law, i.e. as 
the proclamation of that law. Despite superficial similarities, the Logos of Heraclitus stands in 
no direct connection with that of the Fourth Gospel.—D.J.H. * 

1137. R. J. Rabel, “Diseases of Soul in Stoic Psychology,” GkRomByzStud 22 (4, ’81) 385- 
393. 

The Stoics sometimes identified diseases of the soul as pathe (“passions, affections, 
emotions”). At other times, they seem to have denied that such diseases were pathe and 
insisted that they were hexeis (“dispositions”). The apparent contradiction in the Stoic theory 
can best be resolved by proper attention to Aristotelian precedents and possible influences. 
When the Stoics thought of a pathos as an occurrent transaction (a movement, impulse, or 
occurrent judgment), they classified it not as a disease but as a breeder of such diseases. A 
dispositional pathos, on the other hand, would have been included among diseases of the soul 
along with the stable and enduring dispositional judgments, or hexeis. Dispositional pathe were 
understood as natural bridges between pathe and hexeis, since they shared equally in the 
characteristics of both.—D.J.H. 

1138. C. J. Simpson, “The Cult of the Emperor Gaius,” Latomus [Brussels] 40 (3, ’81) 489-511. 

The charge of impiety against the emperor Gaius was based not on his identification with or 
assimilation to Jupiter, but on his rivalry with and rejection of Jupiter. The cult of Gaius that 
was set up to honor his numen seems to have followed the Augustan precedent. His pretension 
to divinity was gratified to some extent by the elaborate rites associated with his cult and by the 
placement of a simulacrum in the temple on the Palatine. The cult was extremely short-lived.—

An important development in the structure of the Christian ministry was brought to its 
conclusion in the 2nd century A.D. when the single order of presbyters, who were also called 
bishops, became two distinct orders—monarchical bishops with ordaining power, and pres¬ 
byters. The stages in this development were (1) the election of “chairmen,” or presidents, by 

local colleges of presbyters in the late 1st century; (2) the assertion ca. 150-180 against the 

■\ 

gnostics that the presidents, or bishops, had received the apostolic canon of truth, or rule of 
faith, from their immediate predecessors in office; and (3) Hippolytus’ presentation of the 
bishop as the summus sacerdos consecrated by other bishops.—D.J.H.

authors dismiss the evidence in Polycarp’s letter about the Ignatian corpus by supposing that 
the letter has been interpolated, and both posit forgeries that were already established by the 
time of Eusebius. Joly assigns the letters of Ignatius to a forger in the seventh decade of the 2nd 
century A.D., while Rius-Camps distinguishes within the seven Ignatian letters between a 
genuine core and the activities of a 3rd-century forger who interpolated this core. But Rius- 
Camps has not produced a revised Greek text manifestly superior to the received text, and he 
fails to carry his readers along with him throughout his argumentation. The most that Joly 
achieves is to make a case for reconsidering the authenticity of Ignatius’ letters and how they fit 
into the setting of 2nd-century Christianity. But he does not seriously consider Ignatius within 
the context of the Johannine-Pauline movement in the late 1st and early 2nd century.—D.J.H.

The Coptic collections of the apocryphal Acts of the Apostles witness to a stage of redaction 
not found in the Arabic and Ethiopic collections. In the Coptic tradition, there are collections 
containing praedicationes, or Acts properly so called (codices P and Q); passion stories only 
(codices B and M 635); and both praedicationes and passion stories of individual apostles 
(codex DM).—D.J.H.

The tone of the writings of the Apostolic Fathers is ethical, and moral earnestness runs 
through every page. The literary forms of their ethical instruction are readily identifiable and 
similar to those of the NT. The chief issues that concerned them were the spiritual life of 
Christians and the health of the Christian community.—D.J.H.

The Greek text of Odes of Solomon 1 l:22ab should be translated: “And everything is accord¬

peg^ sou in 11:21 is a scribal error for en sou. In 11:23 the correct reading is kai 

karpophorei (“but rather it bears fruit”). The Greek text of 11:24b may originally have read: 
tryphe he en tp paradeisg eis tous aidnas (“delight that is in paradise forever”). These observa¬ 
tions are most compatible with the assumption that the Greek text derived from a Semitic 
original.—D.J.H.

F. C. Baur’s broad understanding of docetism (“either objectivity is denied to the human in 
Christ, or at least the human is so separated from the divine that there is no personal unity 
between the two”) was basically correct. The articles on docetism in the standard reference 
works misrepresent to some extent its precise theological scope in the 2nd century A.D., and 
P. Weigandt’s narrow definition of the term “docetism” is open to serious objections.—D.J.H.

In light of T. F. Glasson’s interpretation [§ 9-546] of the semeion of the Son of Man in 
Mt 24:30 as his ensign, or standard, the riddle presented by the phrase semeion ekpetaseds en 
ouranp in Didache 16:6 can be solved: The phrase refers to a standard, or banner, spread out in 
the sky. The banner is the visible counterpart of the sign of the trumpet; both semeia prepare for

The Apostolic Fathers had in common a spirituality of imperfection in the face of the uncer¬

disunity (Ignatius), more exciting religion (Clement), error (Barnabas, Didache), and rigid 
perfectionism (Shepherd of Hermas).—D.J.H.

1156. L. A. Brighton, “The Ordination of Women: A Twentieth-Century Gnostic Heresy?” 
ConcJourn 8(1, ’82) 12-18. 

The role of women in gnosticism reflected the gnostic theological tenets that God is both 
masculine and feminine, and that the feminine element in God is as essential as the masculine. 
Since there was a correlation between the gnostic practice of ordaining women and gnostic 
theology, it is obvious that the early church rejected the ordination of women on theological 
grounds.—D.J.H.

The gnostic documents from Nag Hammadi contain many criticisms directed against the ' 
idolatrous practices of the pagans and their philosophy. These criticisms were based on gnostic 
anthropology, which assigned pagans to the material order as opposed to the psychic and ^ 
spiritual orders. Nevertheless, because the gnostics could participate in pagan rites and had 
recourse to philosophy in elaborating their theology, they appeared less intransigent to the 
pagans than the orthodox Christians did.—D.J.H.

The Logos Christologies in the Nag Hammadi corpus fall into three categories: (1) Some texts 
represent the superficial adaptation of Logos terminology found in much gnostic use of philos¬ 
ophy. They have taken the Johannine “Christ is Logos’’ and attached it to a divine triad, to one 
of the aeons in the pleroma, or to the revealer. (2) The Valentinian writings contain a tradition of 
exegetical interpretation that sought to provide an account of the varied functions of the Logos 
in Jn 1:1-18. Such speculation was motivated by the concern to give a gnostic account of the 
biblical text. (3) Tripartite Tractate represents an independent adaptation of gnostic thought to a 
tradition of philosophical Logos speculation and an emerging consensus as to the requirements | 
of true Christian teaching. Representing a school of Alexandrian gnostics, this work aimed to 
show pagans that the revealing activity of the Logos through the gnostic savior provides the i 
only true knowledge and worship of the Unknowable Father.—D.J.H.

aspects of Christ, personifying them in the form of angels. The illuminators also function as 
celestial or supercelestial places inhabited by figures representing Christ (Man, Son of Man) and 
the two churches (spirituals, psychics). Far from being essentially pagan, the doctrine of the 
four illuminators reflects Valentinian gnosticism.—D.J.H.

After a brief introduction to Gospel of Truth, the article grapples with its ideas of ultimate 
reality and meaning: (1) The origin of life and meaning is the Father, who is also called “Father 
of all” and “Father of truth.” (2) The redemption of the gnostic community is effected through 
Jesus. (3) The gnostic community discovers its ultimate reality through the revelation of the 
Father’s gnosis mediated by Jesus; through an understanding of its own lack as it is involved in 
a materialistic existence; and through its awakening from ignorance, response to the Father’s 
call, and appropriation of his gnosis. [The same issue (pp. 311-313) contains R. H. Drummond’s

Despite the apparent similarities between gnostic encratism and Christian monasticism in 
Upper Egypt during the 4th century A.D., the two movements differed profoundly. The 
asceticism of the Christian monks (and the pagan philosophers) was essentially a moral prepara¬ 
tion for a spiritual goal. But gnostic encratism was an end in itself and the sine qua non of 
salvation; it proceeded from the gnostic rejection of the world and the body.—D.J.H.

Taking its starting point from the passage in Apocryphon of John that describes the revealer 
as having the forms of a youth, an old man, and a servant (CG II, /, 1:30-2:9; cf. BG 8502 II, 
21:3-13), the article situates the motif of trimorphy in the context of the traditions about the 
polymorphy of Christ found in gnostic texts, the NT Apocrypha, and patristic writings. Then it 
calls attention to some parallels in rabbinic literature (e.g. h. Hag. 14a) and in Jewish traditions 
about Metatron-Yahoel. The trimorphic mythology in Apocryphon of John reflects the confla¬ 
tion of two traditions about the bimorphy of Christ: young man/old man, and form of God/form 
of a servant.—D.J.H.

part of it. The body of the article discusses the Coptic and Greek versions of the logion, situates

first dealing with characters from the OT and Apocrypha (Aaron, Abdon, Abel, Abiathar, etc.), 
and the second with those from the NT (Agabus, Agrippa, Alexander, Alphaeus, etc.). A 
five-page chronological chart facilitates cross-referencing between the different periods of 
Israel’s history.

This concordance to the OT and the NT provides entries for all but 135 French words found in 
the Bible de JeVusalem. For each word, there is an indication of its frequency and a list of all its 
occurrences (with several words of context). The words appear according to their alphabetical 
order in French, and the occurrences are listed according to the traditional order of biblical 
books. Special provisions have been made for proper names, numbers, and homographs and 
polysemies. The appendix contains five statistical tables. The team responsible for carrying out 
the project included R.-F. Poswick, E. de Borchgrave, J.-M. Froidcoeur, A. Van Kerrebroeck,

After sketching Goodspeed’s family background and early environment, this volume deals 
with his contributions to NT study in five major areas: his Ephesian hypothesis and its implica¬ 
tions for the formation of the Pauline corpus and the NT, his translation of the NT, his transla¬ 
tion of the Apocrypha and related contributions to research on the apocryphal literature, his 
role in the debate over the Hellenistic versus the Semitic background of the NT, and his volume 
on the life of Jesus. The appendixes provide a classified and annotated list of Goodspeed’s 
books and pamphlets, as well as a list of his publications.

age (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1981, paper $5.95) 110 pp. LCN: 81-70591. ISBN: 0-8006-1630-8. 

This book is both a positive statement about the Bible as the word of God, and a critical 
examination of certain fundamentalist preconceptions that keep many people from reading the 
Bible clearly. Its six chapters consider the authority of the Bible, the nature of authority, 
authority for Christians, Scripture and the church. Scripture’s world and ours, and taking the 
Scriptures on pilgrimage. Countryman, associate professor of NT at Brite Divinity School, 
Texas Christian University, in Forth Worth, TX, argues that “we should not ignore the fallibil¬ 
ity of Scripture but should understand it as the condition of God’s communicating with us in this 
created universe, where we are all bound to the limitations of time and space.’’

Donfried, professor of NT and early Christianity at Smith College in Northampton, MA, 
seeks to demonstrate how the gospel (“the dynamic word’’) was proclaimed and articulated by 
different NT authors in and for different communities. Under the heading “Paul the apostle in 
the early church,’’ he treats theology and praxis (1 Corinthians), Paul’s understanding of salva¬ 
tion, and developments after Paul. Then he considers the Synoptic Gospels: a word about 
suffering (Mk), a word about righteousness (Mt), and a word about mercy (Lk). The final 
section is devoted to the Fourth Gospel in the Johannine community, and Revelation as a word 
about God’s faithfulness and justice.

Baker, 1981, $19.95) xvi and 854 pp. ISBN: 0-8010-3496-5. 

The unique feature of this edition of The Greek New Testament (1975), and the feature that 
justifies the word “analytical’’ in its title, is the grammatical analysis located immediately below 
each word of the Greek text. Every grammatical “tag’’ consists primarily of capital letters. For 
example, the tag for the nominative masculine singular noun theos is “N-NM-S.” In some cases 
a secondary analysis of function is added to the basic analysis of the word’s form. A 58-page 
grammatical analysis (including seven lists) concludes the volume. The editors, missionaries to 
Southeast Asia associated with the Wycliffe Bible Translators, prepared the volume in connec¬ 
tion with the University of Minnesota Computer Center.

Fujita, associate professor of religious studies at Iona College in New Rochelle, NY, aims to 
explain the origin, background, content, and significant theological ideas of the biblical writ¬ 
ings. After comments on studying the Bible, he treats the OT under six headings: Tetrateuch, 
Deuteronomic writings, prophetic tradition, postexilic development, poetry and wisdom, and 
the relationship between the OT and the NT. The NT is discussed in seven chapters: back¬ 
ground, Gospels, Acts, letters of Paul, Deuteropauline and Pastoral letters, Hebrews and

The expression “semantic logic” in this book’s title marks the introduction of insights from 
mathematical logic and logic theory of meaning into the study of the OT and NT. An introduc¬ 
tory chapter treats biblical semantic logic, biblical languages, logico-linguistics, Semitic lan¬ 
guage study and confusion, and interpreting biblical Greek. Then meaning is examined under 
these headings: sense and reference, the logico-linguistic context of reference, reference and 
intention, and semantic values. Finally, there are chapters on proper names (referential func¬ 
tions and ancient names, criteria of identity, naming Yhwh), reference and predication, refer¬ 
ence to roots, and generality (theory of meaning). The appendix criticizes W. F. Albright’s use 
of the term “logic.”

The English translation of Un Dieu qui parle [NTA 23, p. 110], this book shows why faith 
must recognize the word of God, how it can rest on that word without reducing it to its human 
expressions, and how it can be guided by that light without mistaking it for more or less 
distorted images. Guillet has been professor of Sacred Scripture at Centre Sevres in Paris since 
1973. 

M. D. Hooker, Studying the New Testament (London: Epworth, 1979, paper £3.25) 224 pp.

Written as a textbook for Methodist local preachers “on trial,” this companion volume to 
W. D. Stacey’s Groundwork of Biblical Studies (1979) offers a plan for working through the NT in 
twelve lessons: the good news about Jesus, “Who then is this?” (Mk I), “the Son of Man must 
suffer” (Mk II), the true Israel (Mt), the Spirit of the Lord (Lk), the gospel for all nations (Acts), 
Paul as apostle to the Gentiles, Paul as pastor of the churches, Paul as theologian, letters from 
other leaders, the spiritual Gospel (Jn), and a faith for all times. Each chapter provides an 
outline of the lesson, comments on selected passages, and suggestions for further study. 
Hooker is Lady Margaret’s professor of divinity at the University of Cambridge.

and 151 pp., plate. Bibliography. LCN: 81-8973. ISBN: 0-89130-510-6. 

This volume offers a systematic explication of the sociohistorical method as understood and 
practiced by S. J. Case (1872-1947). After setting forth the educational dialectic at the heart of the 
University of Chicago from its inception and describing Case’s character and intellectual devel¬ 
opment, Hynes examines the sociohistorical method with reference to Case’s accomplishments 
as a NT scholar and early church historian. Finally, he assesses the major intellectual influences 
on the genesis of this method. His conclusion is that, for all the strengths of Case’s sociohis¬ 
torical approach, there were several areas of crucial weakness that led to the diminution of its 
star in the face of supposedly more modem approaches.

King proposes to welcome Novum Testamentum graece (26th ed., 1979) with what he calls a 
“Greek manuscript profile” of 2 Peter, Galatians, 1-2 Thessalonians, the Fourth Gospel, and 
Revelation. The profiles exhibit some of the characteristics of the manuscripts’ right readings, 
and are a way of meeting F. J. A. Hort’s requirement that knowledge of documents precede 
judgment on the readings they contain. The goal of the project is to measure the manuscripts’ 
agreement with the autographs. The booklet is available from the author at 75 Mulgrave Street,

The development of a Habilitationsschrift accepted by the Karl-Marx-Universitat in Leipzig 
in 1975, this volume first explores the views of German-speaking Catholic theologians since 
1943 regarding the basis of the authority of the NT writings. The following issues are treated: 
early church witnesses and conciliar decisions, tradition, inspiration, apostolicity, the content 
of Scripture, the efficacy of the word and the self-evidence of the Scriptures, the “autopistie” 
of the church, and the authority of the Lord. The second part discusses the basis of the 
authority of the NT in the writings of modem Protestant theologians. Kiihne concludes that the 
essence and activity of the word of God (and biblical authority) is and will be the major theme in 
controversial theology.

Prepared as a doctoral dissertation under the direction of E. C. Hobbs and presented to the 
Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, CA, in 1975, this study first looks at the major 
grammars of Hellenistic Greek that have been in use during the past century and at the linguistic 
framework upon which each is built. Then it considers the development in contemporary 
linguistics of N. Chomsky’s transformational-generative theory of grammar, especially the part 
of the syntax that covers embedding transformations. The last chapter investigates one type of 
embedding transformation in Hellenistic Greek, namely nominalizations, or embedded sentences 
functioning as noun phrases. Schmidt teaches in the department of religion at Texas Christian 
University in Fort Worth, TX.

Stacey, principal of Wesley College in Bristol, UK, has written this handbook especially with 
Methodist local preachers “on trial” in mind. First he orients beginners in biblical studies by 
introducing the basic disciplines, English translations, and study aids. Then he discusses back¬ 
ground material: transculturalization, geography, weather and calendar, cosmology, social 
structure, history, archaeology, languages, canon, ancient manuscripts, and critical methods. 
After an 89-page treatment of the OT, he devotes 131 pages to the NT: Jesus, the primitive 
Christian community, the Synoptic problem, the Synoptic Gospels, the Fourth Gospel, Jewish

Teeple, executive director of the Religion and Ethics Institute and author of The Literary 
Origin of the Gospel of John (1974), seeks to guide both students and the general public to a 
better understanding of the Bible by showing them how to study it as historians do. After 
surveying the causes of the widespread misunderstanding of the Bible, he sketches the history 
of biblical interpretation to the present and explains the basic principles and methods of the 
modem historical approach. He concludes by listing the benefits of the historical approach, 
noting that it “frees our minds for intellectual progress in religion.”

pp. Bibliography. Indexed. LCN: 81-47837. ISBN: 0-06-060731-9. 

Beare, professor emeritus of NT studies at Trinity College, University of Toronto, aims to 
bring out the significance of Matthew as an Evangelist, author, and theologian, and thus to look 
upon his work in its totality. The 57-page introduction discusses the Greek text of Mt, the 
general character of the Gospel, authorship and milieu, the narrative, the sayings of Jesus in the 
discourses, the Evangelist’s teaching, and the question of sources. The translation and com¬ 
mentary are presented under the following headings: the nativity of Jesus (1:1-2:23); prepara¬ 
tion for the public ministry (3:1-4:22); opening of the public ministry (4:23-11:1); doubts, 
criticisms, and overt hostility (11:2-13:58); sharpening of the conflict (14:1-25:46); the passion 
narrative (26:1-27:66); and the resurrection of Jesus (28:1-20).

The revised and updated version of a doctoral dissertation directed by C. M. Martini and 
accepted by the Pontifical Biblical Institute in 1976, this study of Paul’s speech at Pisidian 
Antioch (Acts 13:16-41) investigates whether and in what measure it has been shaped by the 
redactor into a literary and thematic unit. After observations on the structure of the speech. 
Buss discusses the salvation-historical introduction to the theme of the preaching of salvation in 
Jesus Christ (13:16b-23), John the Baptist in the framework of the proclamation of salvation 
(13:24-26), the passion and resurrection kerygma (13:27-31), the resurrection of Jesus in the 
witness of the OT (13:32-37), and the conclusion of the speech (13:38-41) and the event of the 
following Sabbath (13:46-47). The closing chapter reflects on the leading theological ideas in 
Acts 13:16-41: the biblical view of history, the place of the cross in God’s saving plan, and the 
promise-fulfillment pattern.

raphy. LCN: 81-2749. ISBN: 0-89130-486-X. 

Prepared as a doctoral dissertation under the direction of D. L. Bartlett and presented to the 
University of Chicago in 1978, this study argues that Mark composed his own feeding story in 
Mk 6:30-44 as a means of controlling how his readers would perceive the traditional feeding 
story in Mk 8:1-10. The four chapters consider hypotheses about doublets and pre-Markan 
cycles with regard to the feeding stories, composition and redaction in Mk 6:30-44 and 8:1-10, 
the feeding stories in the context of the Gospel as a whole, and the implied readers of the 
Gospel. Fowler observes that Mk was apparently written almost as a writ of divorce between 
certain segments of Judaism and Christianity.

In his twenty-page introduction to the Fourth Gospel, Groenewald discusses its character,

and date of origin, and literary structure. The body of the book presents an Afrikaans transla¬ 
tion of each pericope and a verse-by-verse exposition. The following general outline is adopted: 
introduction (1:1-18); Jesus reveals himself before his own people (1:19-12:50); Jesus reveals 
himself before the inner circle of his followers (13:1-17:26); and Jesus reveals himself before the 
whole world (18:1-21:25).

8028-3549-X. 

In his verse-by-verse commentary on the Greek text of Mt, Gundry pays special attention to 
Matthew’s literary style and theological message, focusing on his use of parallelism and his 
vocabulary in an effort to determine the location, extent, and purpose of the Matthean redac¬ 
tion. In addition to the commentary on Mt, the volume contains an introduction, some higher- 
critical conclusions, and a theological postscript. Gundry, author of The Use of the Old Testa¬ 
ment in St. Matthew's Gospel (1967) and professor of religious studies at Westmont College in 
Santa Barbara, CA, concludes that the Gospel was written ca. A.D. 65-67 in Antioch of Syria by 
the apostle Matthew on the basis of Mk and other sources.

This translation of Nachfolge und Charisma [NTA 13, p. 156] provides an exegesis of Mt 
8 :21-22 (“let the dead bury their dead”), offers history-of-religions considerations relating to 
the charismatic and eschatological background of following Jesus, and reflects on the charis¬ 
matic and eschatological distinctiveness of Jesus’ call to follow him. Hengel concludes that 
Jesus’ unique way of calling individuals to “follow after” him was an expression of his “un- 
derivable ‘messianic’ authority.”

citizens of that kingdom.” The eleven parables are found in Mt 13:1-9, 18-23; Mt 13:24-30, 
36-43; Mt 13:31-33/Mk 4:26-29; Lk 10:25-37; Lk 15:11-32; Lk 16:19-31; Lk 14:25-33; Mt 19:23-

The first volume in this three-volume commentary on the Fourth Gospel was written in 
English and appears now for the first time. It provides a pericope-by-pericope exposition of 
in 1-12: Prologue (1:1-18), the witness of the Baptist (1:19-34), the witness of the disciples

A reprint of the 1958 translation of Jesu Verheissung fiir die Volker (1956). The first part 
establishes that Jesus pronounced a stem judgment on the Jewish mission, forbade his disciples 
to preach to non-Jews during his lifetime, and limited his own activity to Israel. The second part 
shows that Jesus removed the idea of vengeance from eschatological expectation, promised the 
Gentiles a share in salvation, and included the Gentiles in his redemptive activity and lordship. 
Jeremias concludes that Jesus expected the incorporation of the Gentiles into the people of God 
as a result of God’s eschatological act of power.

After delineating the method of literary criticism used in this exploration of Lk-Acts from the 
perspective of story, Johnson considers the stmcture of the story, the people’s acceptance and 
rejection of God’s prophet (“the Christ must suffer”), and the witnesses in Jemsalem and 
beyond (“you are witnesses of these things”). The final chapter presents theological reflections 
on Lk-Acts as world-affirming, eschatology as God’s visitation and reversal, and the response 
of repentance. Johnson is also the author of Sharing Possessions (1981).

After giving an overview of recent parable research and discussing the nature and literary 
characteristics of the Gospel parables, this volume offers interpretations of specific parables 
under four major headings: the sure coming of the kingdom (sower and soils, mustard seed, seed 
growing on its own), the crisis of the coming kingdom (barren fig tree, rich fool, six brothers), 
the grace and repentance of the kingdom (the lost, the Pharisee and the tax collector), and the 
character of discipleship in the kingdom (unmerciful servant, compassionate Samaritan, per¬ 
sistent widow). Jones was associate professor of NT interpretation at Southern Baptist 
Theological Seminary in Louisville, KY, until 1979. He is now senior minister of the First

centuries, the decline of Mk from the Middle Ages to the I8th century, the recognition of Mk as 
the first Gospel by H. S. Reimams and the 19th-century liberals, the recognition of Mark as a 
theologian by W. Wrede and 20th-century scholars, the form critics, W. Marxsen and the 
redaction critics, and the restoration of Mk beginning in 1969.

Accepted as a Habilitationsschrift in 1981 by the Catholic theological faculty at the Univer¬ 
sity of Vienna, this investigation of Luke’s understanding of Jesus’ miracles is divided into four 
major parts: the Lukan redaction of the Markan exorcisms (Lk 4:31-37; 4:38-39; 8:22-25; 8:26- 
39; 9:37-43a), the Lukan redaction of the Markan statements about exorcisms (Lk 4:40-41; 
6:17-19; 9:1-6; 9:49-50), the Lukan omissions of Markan statements about exorcisms (Lk 4:42- 
44; 6:12-16), and the Lukan statements about exorcisms without parallels in Mk (texts from Q, 

L, and Acts). Kirchschlager concludes that Luke subsumed Jesus’ exorcisms under the key 
word therapeuein, perceiving them in conjunction with his teaching as two aspects of Jesus’ 
activity for the coming reign of God.

adopted: the preparation (14:1-11), the last meal (14:12-25), the event on the Mount of Olives 
(14:26-52), the trial before the Jews (14:53-72), the trial before the pagans (15:l-20a), the death

Prepared as a doctoral dissertation under the direction of P. Bonnard and accepted by the 
theological faculty of the University of Lausanne in 1981, this study first surveys the theme of 
judgment in Mt and explores the presentation of Christ as both judge of the world and master of 
the Law (5:17-20) with reference to Christian existence (5:21-48&gt;and true and false obedience 
(7:13-27). Then it examines the church and the disintegration of Israel (8:10-12; 10:15; 11:20-24; 
12:41-42; 21:28-22:14; 23:29-24:2) as well as Israel as a reunited people and the church in search 
of its identity. Attention is also given to the church facing judgment (13:10-17, 24-30, 36-43; 
18:1-35; 19:27-20:16) and the importance of being vigilant (24:37-25:46). Marguerat argues that 
Matthew attributed a capital importance to the final appearance of human beings before God for 
judgment.

suchung zur Einzugsperikope, Erfurter Theologische Studien 43 (Leipzig: St. Benno-Verlag,

This tradition-historical investigation of the accounts of Jesus’ entrance into Jerusalem 
(Mk 11:1-10; Mt 21:1-9; Lk 19:(28)29-38; Jn 12:12-19) was carried out under the direction of 
H. Schiirmann. After establishing that the Matthean and Lukan versions depend on the Markan 
account, the study discusses the pre-Markan form and arrangement of the story. Then it asks 
whether Mk 11:1-10 constitutes a literary unity, and distinguishes between the early form of the 
story (vv. 1, 7c-10) and the pre-Markan expansion (vv. lb-7b). The final chapter asks whether a 
pre-Johannine account underlies Jn 12:12-19, and argues that Jn 12:12-15 is an adaptation of the 
early form of the story contained in Mk 11:1, 7c-10. Marz is also the author of Das Wort Gottes 
bei Lukas (1974).

paper $8.95) xiii and 322 pp. Indexed. LCN: 80-84651. ISBN: 0-8042-0409-8. 

This reassessment of the religious experience of Jesus begins with the Gospels and certain 
other NT insights preserved in traditional Christian orthodoxy. Based on the assumption that 
what Jesus taught was what he himself learned by experience, the book contains fifteen chap¬ 
ters: the Baptizer, the baptism of Jesus, in the desert—and beyond, the announcement of a 
kingdom, images of the kingdom, the parable collections, the parables and the passion, Jesus 
and the unclean spirits, the messianic healings, the unclean, forgiveness, discipleship as the love 
of enemies, discipleship as renunciation, prayer and trust, and Jesus and his future. Michaels is 
professor of NT at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary in South Hamilton, MA.

DM 39) 190 pp. Bibliography. ISBN: 3-460-00101-1. 

The slightly revised and updated version of a Habilitationsschrift accepted by the theological 
faculty at Freiburg in 1979, this volume questions whether Jesus reckoned with his violent death 
as a likely or even certain and unavoidable end. After discussing discipleship and the imitation 
of Jesus’ suffering, it considers Jesus’ expectation of and certainty about death as a historical 
problem, the possible significance of Mk 1:9-11 parr., the death of John the Baptist, the 
“decree” of death in Mk 3:6, the so-called Galilean crisis, Jesus’ death on the cross as a 
consequence of the authoritative claim expressed in his words and acts, and the problem of 
retrojecting Jesus’ expectation of his death and his certainty about it to the time of his public 
activity in Galilee. The final chapter reflects on discipleship as unconditional service for the 
reign of God in following Jesus. Oberlinner argues that, although Jesus’ violent death in 
Jerusalem could not have come as a complete surprise, the Gospel tradition does not allow us to 
ascribe to him the certain expectation of such a death.

After discussing early Christian preaching as furnishing material for the Gospels, this intro¬ 
duction to Mk treats the need for a Gospel, the passion, the Son of Man, the power of Jesus in 
word and miracle, the disciples before the word of the Lord, and faith and community. The final 
chapters deal with the origin of Mk and its relevance for the church today. O’Grady is also the 
author of Models of Jesus (1981).

Orchard, the author of Matthew, Luke and Mark (1976), maintains that the procedure 
adopted in this synopsis is the one best calculated to indicate the advantages and disadvantages 
of the Griesbach, or Two-Document, hypothesis. According to him, this synopsis of the four 
Gospels in English breaks new ground in several ways: the order of the columns (Mt, Lk, Mk, 
Jn); the possibility of reading each Gospel in its natural order; the coordination of the transla¬ 
tions of all parallel passages with the Greek original; the breaking down of the parallel pericopes 
so as to clarify their structure; the specific goal of illustrating the Griesbach, or Two-Gospel, 
hypothesis; the frank declaration of principles and manner of construction; and the division into 
396 pericopes with titles.

Regina, a specialist in the philosophy of religion at the Universita di Macerata, first surveys 
interpretations and criticisms of D. F. Strauss’s Das Leben Jesu (1835-36), discusses the inevi¬ 
tability of his mythical explanation, and examines his analysis of the various parts of Jesus’ life: 
infancy, public life, and from transfiguration to ascension. The remaining chapters deal with 
Strauss’s shift from the life of Jesus to the idea of humanity, his replies to opponents, idea of 
Christian dogma as the destruction of the historical figure of Jesus, return to theology, and 
search for a conclusive radicality.

Mohr-Siebeck, 1981, paper DM 59) xi and 614 pp. Bibliography. Indexed. ISBN: 3-16-144469-8. 

Prepared as a doctoral dissertation under the direction of O. Betz and accepted by the 
Evangelical theological faculty at Tubingen in 1981, this volume first discusses the Jesus-tradi- 
tion with reference to the Synoptic problem, “classical” form criticism, the way of tradition, 
the origin of tradition, and the analysis of tradition. The second chapter considers Jewish 
education in the home, synagogue, and school, and then focuses on Jesus’ education. The third 
chapter treats the authority of Jesus as teacher, prophet, and Messiah. The fourth chapter 
examines Jesus’ public teaching with regaid to his preaching before the crowds, the language of 
his teaching, its formal characteristics, and the discourses. The fifth chapter concentrates on 
Jesus teaching of his disciples: the circle of disciples, their being sent forth, esoteric instruc¬ 
tion, and the locally based supporters of Jesus. Riesner concludes that, though Jesus had much 
in common with contemporary Jewish teachers, the differences between them were even more 
striking.

30 (2nd ed.; Giessen—Basel: Brunnen, 1982, paper) 45 pp. ISBN: 3-7655-9030-4. 

Schlatter’s five lectures on the gifts of Christ as presented in the Sermon on the Mount deal 
with the splendor of being Jesus’ disciples (Mt 5:3-16), the perfection of our community 
(Mt 5:17-48), the freedom of serving God (Mt 6:1-18), discipleship freed from possessions 
(Mt 6:19-34), and the preparation of the disciples for their struggle (Mt 7:1-27). Delivered and 
first published in 1928, these lectures have been revised slightly. The two-page introduction is 
by R. Riesner.

The first edition of this commentary on Lk 1:1-9:50 was described in NTA 14, p. 352. This 
edition has been amplified with a new two-page preface and a two-page bibliographic supple¬ 
ment. The commentary covers the proem (Lk 1:1-4), Jesus’ origins in God (1:5-2:52), the 
“pre-kerygma” of John the Baptist (3:1-20), the beginning of Jesus’ preaching of the kingdom 
(3:21^:44), and Jesus’ activity among the people throughout all the land of the Jews (5:1-9:50).

Schweizer, who has also contributed the volumes on Mt and Mk to the series, presents his 
commentary on Lk according to this general outline: foreword about Luke’s aims (1:1-4), the 
infancy stories about John the Baptist and Jesus (1:5-2:52), the gathering of the community 
(3:1-9:50), on the way to Jerusalem (9:51-19:27), and the passion and resurrection (19:28- 
24:53). For each pericope, there is a German translation, a literary-critical analysis, a verse-by- 
verse exposition, and concluding remarks. The seven excursuses treat Israel and the nations, 
the proclamation of Christ in the prehistory, salvation history, the significance of Israel, the 
final coming and the end of history, the understanding of Jesus’ death on the cross, and the 
question of a special source in the Lukan passion narrative.

The slightly revised version of a doctoral dissertation directed by D. Mmguez and accepted 
by the Pontifical Biblical Institute in 1980, this investigation of the structure of Jn 13-17 first 
clarifies the issues by examining the suggestions of scholars from A. Loisy to M.-E. Boismard. 
Then after discussing the structure of the passage as a whole, it concentrates on the structure of 
the parts: love glorified (13:1-38); the place of the departure, or the urgency of believing and 
loving Christ by keeping his commandments (14:1-31); loving one another at the heart of

conflicts (15:1-16:3); the hour of the departure, or the imminence of perfect joy amidst the pains 
of childbirth (16:4-33); and the glorifying prayer (17:1-26). The final section discusses the 
covenantal structure of Johannine agape in the various parts of the discourse.

Prepared as a doctoral dissertation under the direction of B. Reicke and M. Barth and 
accepted by the theological faculty at the University of Basel in 1977, this study aims to 
demonstrate the significance and function of the OT Jubilee theology in Lk. After a survey of 
the OT Jubilee legislation, the volume examines the rejection of Jesus at Nazareth according to 
Lk 4:16-30 from the perspective of its theological and literary background in the year of Jubilee, 
with regard to the implications of the Jubilee theme for the Christology of the passage, and with 
regard to the coherence of the pericope itself. Then other themes and passages in Lk that may 
contain Jubilee motifs are proposed. Finally, Sloan reflects on the implications of the Jubilee 
theology for certain basic questions about Luke’s theology and purpose, and asks whether 
Jesus proclaimed a year of Jubilee.

manifest the same basic structure. There are also chapters on Jesus as both preacher and the 
one preached, and on Jesus and Paul in the light of Rom 3:21-30. Some practical hints about 
structural analysis conclude the volume. Smit teaches biblical exegesis at the Moller-Instituut in 
Tilburg.

Stanley, the author of A Modern Scriptural Approach to the Spiritual Exercises (1967), shows 
how Mk can serve as a guide for people making the Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius Loyola. The 
topics that he treats are the Markan prologue (1:1-15), the call of the two pairs of brothers 
(1:16-20), Mark’s image of Jesus constructed from earlier tradition (1:21-3:12), the call of the 
Twelve and their subsequent mission (3:13-19; 6:6b-13, 30-32), three reactions to Jesus and the 
discernment of spirits (3:20-35), “in parables’’ (4:1-34), imagination as a means of being present 
to Jesus (4:35-5:43), the stratagems of Satan (8:11-13; 10:2-9; 12:13-17), the strategies of Jesus 
(8:27-38; 9:30-37; 10:31-45), finding the heart of Christ, the Last Supper (14:1-26), Gethsemane 
and the arrest of Jesus (14:27-52), the events on Calvary and the burial of Jesus (15:15-47), the 
resurrection (16:1-20), and a contemplation to attain love (12:28-34).

Published originally in German as Die historische Glaubwiirdigkeit der Evangelien (4th rev. 
ed., 1977), this investigation of the historical credibility of the NT discusses the dates of 
composition of the NT books, the reliability of the Gospels as historical sources, the legitimate 
objects of historical statements as illustrated by the virgin birth, the credibility of the miracles, 
and the resurrection as a subject of historical research. Particular attention is given to the views 
of R. Bultmann and W. Marxsen. Staudinger maintains that a Christian theology that does not 
see the decisive importance of the historical question demolishes its own foundations.

Prepared as a doctoral dissertation under the direction of G. Klein and accepted by the

subject to Satan’s power, ignorant), and responsibility and possibilities. Then it deals with 
conversion; the terminology (human decision, divine work, the deed of the missionaries, 
“neutral” references to growth), God’s saving plan as the objective framework, and the presen¬ 
tation of individual conversions (Lk 7:36-50; 19:1-10; 15:1-32; 23:39-43; Acts 8:26-39; 16:13-15; 
16:25-34; 13:7-12; 3:16). Taeger concludes that, for Luke, the person was more in need of 
correction (corrigendus) than of salvation (salvandus). 

A. VON JuCHEN, Die Kampfgleichnisse Jesu, Lese-Zeichen (Munich: Kaiser, 1981, paper DM

Observing that the struggle motif in many of the Gospel parables is not adequately interpreted 
as an idealistic metaphor, von Jiichen explores the parables of struggle in terms of the inner life 
in the parables of Jesus, Jesus’ enemies, Jesus’ struggle for the people’s development as a 
people, God in parable, the political meaning of Jesus’ preaching, and the spirituality of 
struggle.

pp. Bibliographies. ISBN: 3-579-04837-6. 

In his nineteen-page introduction to Acts, Weiser treats its title, content, and structure; 
literary Gattung and theological aims; sources; author, place, and time of composition; and 
textual tradition. Then he provides for each of the twenty-five pericopes in Acts 1:1-12:25 a 
German translation, a bibliography, a literary analysis, a discussion of the relation between 
Luke’s redaction and the tradition, and an exposition of Luke’s ideas and statements. The five 
excursuses concern the origin and tradition history of the Lukan ascension account, “witness” in 
Lk-Acts, the speeches in Acts, the “Hellenists,” and the call of Paul. 

D. B. WOLL, Johannine Christianity in Conflict: Authority, Rank, and Succession in the First

viii and 188 pp. Bibliography. LCN; 81-1795. ISBN: 0-89130-471-1. 

Accepted as a doctoral dissertation (directed by J. Z. Smith) by the University of Chicago, 
this study argues that the category of authority (together with related terms such as power, 
legitimation, rank, succession, and hierarchy) points to one of the predominant and controlling 
aspects of the situation addressed in the Fourth Gospel. The first section examines Jn 13:31- 
14:31 as a pivotal text for understanding the processes of social interaction of which the Gospel 
was a part: the hierarchy—the prior ascent of the Son (13:31-14:3), the concentration of author¬ 
ity in the Son (14:4-11), and the place of the disciples in relation to the Son in works (14:12-24) 
and in words (14:25-26). Woll concludes at the end of the second section that the composition of 
the Fourth Gospel was occasioned by a situation in which claims of direct, independent access 
to divine authority had, in the Evangelist’s eyes, gotten out of control by becoming a threat to 
the primacy of the Son.

This study seeks to trace the origin and function of the code of household ethics in 1 Pet 
2:11-3:12. After surveying contemporary interpretations of 1 Peter and of household ethics in 
the NT, the author investigates philosophical discussions “concerning the constitution” and 
“concerning household management” from Plato to Hellenistic Jews and Neopythagoreans. 
Then he examines the apologetic use of the subordination ethic by minority religious communi¬ 
ties in Roman society. Particular attention is given to Greco-Roman criticism of Eastern reli¬ 
gions and to the apologetic function of the household code in 1 Peter. Balch concludes that the 
ultimate origin of the household ethic is to be found in Greek political thought. Five appendixes 
are included.

Nine articles by Barrett on various topics in Paul’s letters have been collected in one volume. 
They concern Christianity at Corinth [§ 9-243], Cephas and Corinth (1963), “things sacrificed to 
idols” in 1 Corinthians 8-10 [§ 9-1006], Paul’s opponents in 2 Corinthians [§ 16-264], pseudapos- 
toloi in 2 Cor 11:13 (1970), ho adikesas in 2 Cor 7:12 (1970), Titus (1969), the fall and responsibil¬

ISBN: 0-89130-475-4. 

Prepared as a doctoral dissertation under the direction of N. A. Dahl and presented to Yale 
University in 1979, this study takes as its starting point Paul’s assertion in Rom 2:11 that there is 
no partiality with God. In order to establish a background for understanding Paul’s statement, 
the author examines the theme of divine impartiality in the OT and deuterocanonical literature, 
the rabbinic writings, and the Philonic corpus. Then she investigates the occurrence of the 
theologoumenon in Rom 1:16-2:29 and situates Paul’s use of it in the Christian trajectory of 
divine impartiality. Bassler concludes that, although it is verbally linked to its Jewish roots, the 
theologoumenon of divine impartiality in Romans makes the point that God’s grace, like his 
judgment, extends equally to Jews and Gentiles.

Starting from the fact that Paul is the only witness of the risen Lord (see 1 Cor 15:8) whose 
writings are available to us, Biser explores the place of the resurrection in Paul’s life and 
activity. Among the topics treated in light of the resurrection theme are Paul’s experience of 
salvation, his language, understanding of revelation, concept of faith, spirituality, view of 
Christian community, and practice of faith.

The eight articles in this volume (all but one previously published) concern Paul as Jew and 
apostle of the Gentiles (1977), why Paul said that by the works of the Law no one is justified 
(1969), gospel and Law [§ 19-630], Law and Spirit (1976), 1 Corinthians as a question for the 
churches today, the Eucharist and the community of churches according to Paul [§ 13-635], the 
concept of sacrifice according to Rom 12:1-2 (1971), and Paul’s understanding of Scripture 
(1976).

As is true for all the handbooks in the series, this volume concentrates on exegetical matters 
of prime importance for translators and indicates possible solutions to translational and linguis¬ 
tic problems. Special attention is given to the structure of the discourse in Ephesians so that 
translators will understand the logical progression of the sections in the letter and how they 
contribute to its message as a whole. The texts of Today’s English Version and the Revised 
Standard Version are provided at the beginning of each section, and the TEV is reproduced at 
the beginning of the discussion of each verse. A glossary of technical exegetical and linguistic 
terms is included.

The fruit of a 1978-79 seminar held at the Centre d’Analyse du Discours Religieux (CADIR) in 
Lyons, this volume is not only a commentary on 1 Peter but also an introduction to the semiotic 
approach to reading biblical texts. After describing the method of semiotic analysis, the authors 
present a commentary on 1 Peter according to the following outline: address (1:1-2), benediction 
(1:3-12), sanctification (1:13-25), edification (2:1-10), subjection (2:11-3:12), deliverance (3:13- 
4:6), judgment (4:7-5:11), and final salutation (5:12-14). The focus of the commentary is on what 
the text says and what it means rather than the concerns of classical exegesis. The authors are 
members of CADIR and teach on the Catholic theological faculty at Lyons.

Corsini, who teaches Greek literature at the University of Turin, notes that the book of 
Revelation concerns the whole of history (not simply its conclusion) as the revelation of Jesus 
Christ. After a 79-page introduction to Revelation, he gives an Italian translation and exposition 
of each pericope. The following general outline is adopted: prologue (1:1-8), the seven letters 
(1:9-3:22), the seven seals (4:1-8:1), the seven trumpets (8:2-11:19), the seven cups (12:1- 
22:5), and epilogue (22:6-21). P. Rossano has supplied a ten-page preface. 

T. J. Deidun, New Covenant Morality in Paul, Analecta Biblica 89 (Rome: Biblical Institute 
Press, 1981, paper 18,500 L or $18.50) xiv and 297 pp. Bibliography. Indexed. 

The slightly revised version of a doctoral dissertation directed by A. Vanhoye and S. Lyonnet 
and accepted by the Pontifical Biblical Institute in 1980, this “theological essay substantiated by 
exegetical argument” deals with important aspects of Christian morality from the Pauline 
perspective of the new covenant. After establishing that the church’s understanding of itself as 
God’s people is the theological context of Christian morality, the volume examines the ground 
and formal content of the new covenant imperative, agape in the new covenant perspective, 
and love and law in new covenant morality. Five appendixes are included. Deidun recommends 
Paul’s new covenant perspective for presenting a renewed moral theology that is essentially 
trinitarian and Christocentric, wholly personal and deeply religious, and capable of synthesizing 
polarities and avoiding extremes.

introduction, a French translation (TOB) and an exposition are given for each pericope: the 
Word of life (1:1-4), God as light (1:5-7), Jesus Christ the just one (1:8-2:2), etc. The conclusion 
discusses the presence of God in Jesus Christ and in human beings. Apart from the introduction 
and conclusion, the material appeared previously in the journal Le Christianisme au XX^ siecle.

1399-6. 

The revised version of a doctoral dissertation directed by J. Morel and accepted in 1976 by 
the Institutum Philosophicum of the theological faculty at the University of Innsbruck, this 
volume first offers conceptual and methodological observations on the sociology of religion. 
Then it examines Paul’s letters in terms of what they reveal about behavioral expectations, 
functions, status and division of roles among men and women, social classes, etc. Funk shows 
how the use of concepts and methods developed in the sociology of religion leads to more exact 
descriptions of phenomena and generates new ideas. He also notes that Paul’s religious outlook 
included both stabilizing and destabilizing factors with regard to social institutions.

77-090222. ISBN: 0-8054-5580-9. 

This investigation of reconciliation in Christ focuses on Eph 2:11-22 (especially v. 14) and the 
nuances of the temple metaphor as they bear on hostilities between groups in society. After 
discussing Christ the wall-breaker, Hull shows how Christ leads people beyond social, sexual, 
sacral, and spiritual barriers. The final chapter portrays Christ as the builder of walls that unite 
people in peace and give them equal access to the Father in one Spirit (see Eph 2:18). Hull is 
pastor of the First Baptist Church in Shreveport, LA. 

B. N. Kaye, The Thought Structure of Romans with Special Reference to Chapter 6 (Fort 
Worth, TX: Schola Press, 1979, paper) ix and 203 pp. Bibliography. 

Prepared as a doctoral dissertation under the direction of B. Reicke and accepted by the 
theological faculty at the University of Basel in 1975, this investigation of the place of chap. 6 in 
the developing thought-structure of Romans first considers the argument in Romans 1-5, 
Romans 5 as a bridge chapter, and the pattern of argument in Romans 6. Then the major 
elements of the argument in chap. 6 are examined in relation to the rest of the letter: sin, 
baptism, relationship with Christ, law and grace, and slavery. Kaye concludes that the way Paul 
moves his line of thought shows that “his bondage to Jesus Christ [made] him think through the 
real meaning of his gospel in human experience in order to bring about the obedience of faith 
among all nations for the sake of the name of Christ.’’

In his seven-page introduction, the author discusses the church at Corinth, the background of 
2 Corinthians, its literary unity, and its structure. The exposition of the epistle follows this 
general outline: greeting and thanksgiving (1:1-11), Paul’s relations with the Corinthians (1:12- 
7:16), the collection for the poor Christians in Jerusalem (8:1-9:15), and Paul’s apostolic author¬ 
ity (10:1-13:14). Kent is president of Grace College and Grace Theological Seminary in Winona

The first part of this examination of the conflict between Peter and Paul at Antioch presents 
an exegesis of Gal 2:14b-21: preliminary questions, analysis of the six sequences of the dis¬ 
course, and the essential ideas. The second part considers the conflict at Antioch and Paul’s 
description of it in the history of exegesis from the Fathers to Thomas Aquinas, and from 
Luther to modern times. The third part compares Gal 2:14b-21 with other Pauline and post-

ISBN: 3-525-53296-2 (paper). 

The revised version of a doctoral dissertation directed by E. Kasemann and accepted by the 
Evangelical theological faculty at Tubingen in 1972, this volume explores the question. Was 
Paul’s ecclesiology only a provisional sketch or was it closely connected with the other themes 
of his theology? After introducing the “riddle” of Pauline ecclesiology, the author discusses the 
starting point of Pauline ecclesiology: community from the gospel, Christ as the basis of com¬ 
munity life, the eschatological situation of the community, the validity of the promise, and faith 
and the Spirit. Then he examines the formative principles of Pauline ecclesiology: gospel and 
office, charisma and ministry, justification and law, and freedom and responsibility. An excur¬ 
sus on justification and community at Qumran is followed by a chapter on the social, critical, 
and ecumenical-missionary implications of Paul’s doctrine of justification for ecclesiology 
today.

ISBN: 3-7887-0646-5. 

The abbreviated arid revised version of a doctoral dissertation directed by F. Hahn and 
accepted by the Evangelical theological faculty at Mainz in 1972, this tradition-historical inves¬ 
tigation of the Christology in Hebrews first considers Jesus as Son: Jesus the exalted one, the 
resurrection and parousia of Jesus, the divine dignity of Jesus, and Jesus the one who became 
human. Then it discusses Jesus the high priest: Jesus the intercessor, the self-offering of Jesus, 
and Jesus’ high-priestly office and the tradition. Loader, who teaches at Perth Theological Hall 
in Australia, concludes by relating the Christology of Hebrews to the situation of the Hellenis- 
tic-Jewish-Christian community to which it was first addressed.

This investigation of Paul’s personality as it is presented in 2 Corinthians perceives him as a 
devout person who flared up (Paul’s sensitivity), a giant who fell on his knees (his humility), and 
a balanced person who conquered himself (his sensitivity and humility). Madros concludes that 
the secret of the fruitful coexistence of contrary impulses within Paul was his love for Christ and 
for the faithful. A. Vanhoye has contributed a foreword.

Indexed. ISBN: 3-16-144132-X. 

This investigation of the role that the book of Revelation has played in the history of the 
church contains five major parts: the struggle of the ancient church (Papias and the presbyters 
of Asia Minor, Gaius of Rome and the so-called Alogi, Dionysius of Alexandria and Eusebius), 
the reinterpretation in the West (Ticonius, Augustine), before and during the Reformation 
(before the breakthrough, the Baptist movements, Luther), the age of Pietism (before Spener, 
Spener and early German Pietism, Wiirttemberg before Bengel, Bengel, after Bengel), and from 
the Enlightenment to the present (the breakthrough of historical criticism, Schleiermacher and 
Baur, the “after-hold” of the 19th century, liberalism, dialectical theology, the so-called bibli- 
cism between 1885 and 1935, further historical-critical work). Maier, author of Das Ende der 
historisch-kritischen Methode (1974) and Mattlidus-Evangelium (1979-80), observes that in 
every period of church history the book of Revelation has been a touchstone of eschatological 
concepts and hermeneutical positions.

Monloubou, professor of Scripture at the Institut Catholique de Toulouse and author of La 
priere selon saint Luc (1976), first considers Paul’s references to the forms of prayer (supplica¬ 
tion, thanksgiving, praise), prayer in relation to the Holy Spirit and love of neighbor, and the 
transition from the gift of grace to thanksgiving (Col 2:6-4:6; Eph 1:15-23). The second part of 
the volume focuses on the specific prayers in 1 Thes 1:2-5; 2:13; 3:9-13; 2 Thes 1:3-5; 1:11-12; 
2:13-14; 1 Cor 1:4-9; Phil 1:3-6; 1:9-11; 2 Cor 1:3-11; Rom 1:8-15; Col 1:3-14; and Phlm 4-6. 
Special attention is paid to Paul’s insistence on the apostolic dimension of prayer.

For each pericope in 1 Peter this volume presents a Swedish translation, notes (on words and 
phrases, textual matters, philology, etc.), a literary analysis, and an exposition. The following 
general outline is adopted: senders and receivers (1:1-2), song of praise and joy (1:3-12), a holy 
life (1:13-25), a life together (2:1-10), Christians in the world (2:11-3:12), a victorious mission 
(3:13-22), the time that still remains (4:1-11), full confidence in suffering and glory (4:12-5:11), 
and epistolary conclusion (5:12-14). Fourteen excursuses are interspersed throughout the com¬ 
mentary, and “introductory” issues are treated in a nine-page final chapter. Olsson, author of 
Structure and Meaning in the Fourth Gospel (1974), is docent in NT exegesis at Uppsala.

After characterizing 1 Corinthians 13 as an eschatological text, this booklet presents an 
exposition of the passage under the following headings: love as the absolutely necessary pre¬ 
supposition (vv. 1-3), the ways of love (vv. 4-7), the this-worldly nature of the gifts of grace 
(vv. 8-12), and love as the main idea (v. 13). The last chapter focuses on the ethic of worship in 
1 Corinthians.

Prete, the author of IIprimato e la missione di Pietro (1969), first discusses 1 Corinthians as a 
whole, the characters and concerns of chap. 7, the religious situation of the Corinthian com¬ 
munity, and the structure of chap. 7. Then he offers an exegetical analysis of the four major 
sections in 1 Cor 7:1-40 under these headings: Christian marriage according to the estimation of 
the apostle (vv. 1-7), teachings about marriage to the new converts of Corinth (vv. 8-24), the 
apostle’s discourse regarding virgins (vv. 25-38), and the widows and their new marriages 
(vv. 39-40).

Press, 1981, paper $13.50) x and 193 pp. Bibliography. LCN: 81-1794. ISBN: 0-89130-483-5. 

Prepared as a doctoral dissertation under the direction of P. J. Achtemeier and presented to 
Union Theological Seminary in Richmond, VA, in 1979, this volume investigates Paul’s under¬ 
standing of the status of the Law as one of the basic elements of continuity between Judaism 
and Christianity. After reviewing recent scholarship on Paul’s view of the status of the Law in 
the church, the author describes the two opposing ways in which scholars construe Rom 3:31 in 
the context of the epistle, conducts an exegesis of the verse’s immediate context (Rom 3:21- 
4:25), and examines another key Pauline text (Rom 10:4) about the status of the Law in the 
church. Rhyne concludes that the idea of faith establishing the Law (Rom 3:31) was Paul’s way 
of spotlighting and explaining the validity of the Law in the Christian community.

and 319 pp. Bibliography. LCN: 81-9407. ISBN: 0-89130-533-5. 

Accepted as a doctoral dissertation (directed by E. Schiissler Fiorenza) by the University of 
Notre Dame in 1978, this study takes as its point of departure the hypothesis that the author of 
1 John was actively engaged in the redaction of the Fourth Gospel. After reviewing research on 
several topics (the Johannine community, the relationship between 1 John and the Fourth 
Gospel, love in the Johannine literature), it considers the meaning of agape and agapan in 
1 John, those sections of the farewell discourse (Jn 15:1-17; 13:34-35; 15:18-16:15) that 
J. Becker assigns to a life situation like that of 1 John, and the remaining agape-passages in the 
Fourth Gospel. Segovia concludes that the redactor working in the setting presupposed by 
1 John sprinkled Jesus’ farewell discourse with assertions of the centrality of Jesus’ death to the 
life of the community, and traced the love command to the lips of Jesus as he prepared the 
disciples for his departure.

ISBN:0-89130-494-0. 

Prepared as a doctoral dissertation under the direction of A. J. Malherbe and presented to 
Yale University, this study first surveys the history of research on the diatribe, sets forth 
prolegomena to a solution of the problem of the diatribe, and reassesses the major sources for 
the diatribe. Then it compares the form and function of the dialogical elements in the diatribe 
and in Romans: address to the imaginary interlocutor, objections and false conclusions, and 
dialogical exchange and exemplum in Rom 3:27-4:25. Stowers concludes that the dialogical 
style of indictment and protreptic in Romans was designed for those who had already made a 
basic commitment to Christianity, and is thus evidence for what might best be described as 
Paul’s “school” preaching. 

J. W. Thompson, The Beginnings of Christian Philosophy: The Epistle to the Hebrews, Cath¬

ISBN: 0-915170-12-4. 

Convinced that attention to the consistent pattern of argumentation and the set of meta¬ 
physical assumptions in Hebrews can help solve the riddle presented by the epistle, the author 
investigates Heb 5:11-14 and Greek paideia, the eschatology of Hebrews as seen in 12:18-29 
[see § 20-578], faith in Hebrews, the katapausis-moXxi in Hebrews, chap. 9 and Hellenistic 
concepts of sacrifice [§ 24-926], the conceptual background and purpose of the midrash in chap. 
7 [§ 22-510], the structure and purposes of the catena in 1:5-13 [see § 21-190], and “outside the 
camp” according to 13:9-14 [§ 22-881]. Thompson, who first applied his approach to Hebrews in 
a doctoral dissertation accepted in 1974 by Vanderbilt University in Nashville, TN, concludes 
that the apparent strangeness of Hebrews reflects the metaphysical assumptions and categories 
developed at Alexandria and perhaps elsewhere in the eastern Mediterranean.

Written for a nonspecialist audience, this exposition of the book of Revelation is presented 
according to the following outline: foreword (1:1-3), epistolary introduction (1:4-8), the intro¬ 
ductory vision of Christ (1:9-3:22), the heavenly overture to the visions of the end-events 
( 4 : 1 - 5 : 14 ), the opening of the seven seals (6:1-7:17), the seventh seal and the seven trumpets 
(8:1-11:19), the severe affliction of the church (12:1-13:18), the encouraging answer of heaven 
(14:1-20), the vision of the seven bowls (15:1-16:21), the sequence of visions of the last judg¬ 
ment (17:1-20:15), the vision of the fully redeemed community of salvation (21:1-22:5), and

3-525-53349-7 (V&amp;R). 

Accepted as a doctoral dissertation (directed by P. Bonnard) by the theological faculty at the 
University of Lausanne, this volume first surveys the possibilities and problems involved in 
studying images in the Pauline epistles and then focuses on the images of the family in 
Paulinism. Special attention is given to the family of Abraham and the family of God in 
Galatians 3-4 and Romans 4 and 8. Then the themes of the familial cycle in the Pauline corpus 
are treated systematically: “you are sons,” brothers and sisters, Jesus the Son of God, Paul and 
his children, the slave in the family, God the Father, and the marriage of Christ and the church. 
The final chapters deal with Paul the image-maker and the relation between theology and 
metaphorical language.

The thoroughly revised and updated version of a doctoral dissertation directed by E. Dinkier 
and accepted by the theological faculty at the University of Heidelberg in 1973, this study of 
1 Corinthians 13 first examines the immediate context and offers a verse-by-verse exegesis of 
the chapter. Then it considers the language, style, and form of 1 Corinthians 13. Wischmeyer 
concludes that the text was composed by Paul, that it belongs to Paul’s correspondence with the 
church at Corinth, and that its original position was between chaps. 12 and 14. Wischmeyer’s 
recent article on the occurrences and meaning of agape in non-Christian antiquity appeared in 
ZeitNTWiss [§ 23-774].

2431-9. 

Boulton, associate professor of religion at Hope College in Holland, MI, argues that the 
Jewish legal tradition shaped by the Pharisees contains long-neglected and substantial resources 
for Christian political ethics. After discussing the Pharisees and their Law and explaining 
Pharisaic Christianity, he suggests postures that Pharisaic Christians might take regarding 
worship, government, peace, the family, homosexuality, and consumption. The last two 
chapters examine the weakness of Pharisaic Christianity and its ecumenical significance.

Cate, associate professor of OT at Golden Gate Baptist Theological Seminary in Mill Valley, 
CA, explores the OT roots of NT faith with special emphasis on the common commitments of 
the OT books. The major topics treated are the knowledge of God, the nature of God, the God 
who acts, the God who chooses, humans as God’s creatures, human rebellion, the redeeming 
God and penitent human beings, divine promises and human hopes, worship, the servants of 
God, beyond the OT, and interpreting the OT.

0-8091-2349-5. 

This exploration in Christology proceeds from the assumptions that (1) Christianity is essen¬ 
tially historical, and (2) historical consciousness cannot simply be reduced to the historical- 
critical method. After discussing the question of continuity between Jesus and faith, it treats the 
ministry of Jesus (mission, word, deed, fate), the decisive eschatological event, and the pro- 
claimer as proclaimed. The last chapter examines some contemporary approaches to Christol¬ 
ogy: incarnation (P. Schoonenberg), resurrection (W. Pannenberg), crucifixion (J. Moltmann), 
and historical word (P. Hodgson). Cook has taught systematic theology at the Jesuit School of 
Theology in Berkeley, CA, since 1972. 

J. S. Croatto, Exodus: A Hermeneutics of Freedom, trans. S. Attanasio (Maryknoll, NY: 
Orbis Books, 1981, paper $4.95) vi and 89 pp. Indexed. LCN: 80-26148. ISBN: 0-88344-111-X. 

In seeking to orchestrate a method of rereading the Bible from the standpoint of the Latin 
American situation, the author concentrates on how the kerygma of liberation is treated in the 
Bible and how it can serve as a model for the hermeneutical process. Particular attention is 
given to the exodus event as “a focal point of the first magnitude and an inexhaustible light.” 
After explaining P. Ricoeur’s approach to philosophical and religious hermeneutics, Croatto 
discusses the exodus as event and word, creation for freedom according to Genesis 1-2, the 
prophet as the “conscientizer” of alienated humanity, Christ as liberator of the oppressed, and 
Paul’s teaching on radical human liberation. Croatto is professor of OT studies and Hebrew at 
the Institute Superior Evangelico de Estudios Teologicos in Buenos Aires. The Spanish original 
of the book was entitled Liberacion y libertad: pautas hermeneuticas (1978).

of the need for a world view. Gese is professor of OT on the Evangelical theological faculty at 
Tubingen.

The English version of Herrschaft [NTA 25, p. 100], this volume treats the theme of authority 
in the Bible under three major headings: authority as a divine provision for salvation, biblical 
encounter with authority, and earthly dominion under God. The authors conclude that the 
distinction between what belongs to God and what belongs to Caesar is the specific biblical 
message on the question of authority.

Hull, formerly professor of NT interpretation at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in 
Louisville, KY, and now pastor of First Baptist Church in Shreveport, LA, looks at the four 
dimensions of God’s love sketched in Eph 3:14-19 and given substance in Jn 3:16: its breadth, 
length, depth, and height. The final chapter explores the connection between love and faith 
established in the two NT passages.

The thirty-four sermons contained in this volume are based on NT exegesis and directed 
toward making “the old, old story’’ of the Bible good news for sin-sick and bewildered people 
today. They treat Christian faith and the riddle of the world (Jn 1:1-18), why be a Christian 
(1 Pet 3:15), what we think of Christ (Mt 22:42), what Christianity is (Col 1:4-5), the waiting 
father (Lk 15:11-32), etc. Four of the sermons were originally published in Hunter’s Teaching 
and Preaching the New Testament (1963).

Kesich, professor of NT at St. Vladimir’s Seminary, first reviews modem discussion of the 
resurrection of Jesus and surveys the background to the NT understanding of resurrection in 
Jewish and Greco-Roman religion. Then he considers the NT evidence for the resurrection 
under the following headings: the cross and the tomb, the empty tomb on the third day, “he 
appeared unto many,’’ “he appeared to me’’ on the road to Damascus, the bodily resurrection, 
and “now is the Son of Man glorified.’’ The appendix provides an English translation of John 
Chrysostom’s Easter homily.

Indexed. ISBN: 3-460-04031-9. 

After discussing the term oikia, this volume considers the house community in early Christian 
literature (Pauline letters. Acts, Synoptic Gospels, post-Pauline letters), the house church in the 
pre-Constantinian period, and history-of-religions analogies in the pagan world and Judaism. 
Klauck, who expressed some of his views on this topic in a recent article in MiinchTheolZeit 
[§ 25-1043], concludes that the house community was the central establishment and cornerstone 
of the local Christian community, the base of missionary activity, the gathering place for the 
Lord’s Supper, the space for prayer, the place of catechetical instruction, and the pledge of 
Christian fellowship.

D. M. Barton (London: SCM, 1981, paper; New York: Oxford University Press, $10.95) 168 pp. 
Bibliography. Indexed. ISBN: 0-334-01320-8. 

A reprint of the 1957 English translation of Verheissung und Erfullung (3rd ed., 1956), which 
was first published in 1945 and then thoroughly revised in 1953. The four chapters in this now 
classic study of Jesus’ eschatological teaching discuss the imminent future of the kingdom of 
God, the eschatological promise (not apocalyptic instruction), the presence of the kingdom of 
God, and the meaning of Jesus’ eschatological message. Kiimmel concludes that in Jesus the 
kingdom of God came into being and in him it will be consummated.

Dieu 21 (Paris: du Seuil, 1982, paper 75 F) 380 pp. Bibliography. Indexed. ISBN: 2-02-006151-1. 

This inquiry into sharing the eucharistic bread according to the NT first examines the 
eucharistic practice of the early Christians: the eucharistic assemblies, the Lord’s Supper and 
its celebration, and the NT accounts of Jesus’ Last Supper (Mt 26:26-29; Mk 14:22-25; 
Lk 22:14-20; 1 Cor 11:23-25). Then it investigates the cultic and testamentary traditions of the 
Last Supper, the three major components of the so-called words of institution (remembrance, 
bread, cup), and the relation of the traditions to the event. The third part discusses the various 
NT presentations of the Last Supper: Mark, Paul, Luke, and John. By way of conclusion, 
Le'on-Dufour provides an “overture” and two appendixes, one on Jewish ceremonial meals and 
the other on the Lord’s Supper and the Jewish Passover meal.

X (cloth), 0-19-502948-8 (paper). 

Mott, professor of Christian social ethics at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary in South 
Hamilton, MA, maintains that the heart of biblical thought mandates efforts to correct 
economic and social injustices in our communities. In developing this premise, he first builds a 
biblical theology of social involvement by exploring the recognition in Scripture of the social 
reality of evil, God’s grace and our action, love and society, God’s justice and ours, and the idea 
of God’s reign as only partially present yet at work in all spheres of life. Then he traces the ways 
in which Christians bring about social change: evangelism, the church as countercommunity, 
strategic noncooperation, political revolution, and creative reform through politics.

Convinced of the need for a profound reexamination of the christological question if the 
church is to construct a solid and positive theology of Judaism, the author discusses the place of 
Christology in the Christian-Jewish encounter, Christology and Judaism in current systematic 
theology, the connection and separation between Jesus’ teaching and Pharisaic Judaism, chris¬ 
tological development and the uniqueness of Christianity, Christology in light of the Auschwitz 
experience, and Christian mission and the Jewish people. Pawlikowski is professor of social 
ethics at the Catholic Theological Union in Chicago.

Richard, professor of systematic theology at Weston School of Theology in Cambridge, MA, 
contends that an emphasis on the cross and the common human experience of suffering can lead 
to a relatively adequate contemporary expression of the event of Jesus Christ. In constructing 
his kenotic Christology, Richard considers Jesus Christ in a technological age, the Jesus of 
history and the Christ of faith, Jesus (his life, ministiy, and message), the form of a servant, the 
theological implication of the development of Christology, kenotic Christology (its history, 
problematics, and possibilities), person and suffering (kenotic anthropology), the suffering

Indexed. ISBN: 3-17-002011-0. 

The treatment of future and hope in the OT focuses primarily on themes: promises to the 
patriarchs and Moses, judgment and salvation, promise for the people, promise for the nations, 
the powerlessness of the messiah, salvation for creation, hope against death, renewal of 
humanity, hope in the Psalms and wisdom literature, and God’s kingship. The part devoted to 
the NT situates the themes within a historical framework: the near reign of God in Jesus’ 
preaching, the experience of Easter and of the Spirit as the basis of new hope among the first 
generations of early Christians, Paul as theological representative of the first generation of early 
Christians, and early Christianity after Paul’s death. Schmidt is professor of OT at the Univer¬ 
sity of Marburg, and Becker is professor of NT at the University of Kiel.

Vienna: Herder, 1981, paper DM 9.80) 87 pp. ISBN: 3-451-19193-8. 

Schnackenburg’s essay on the resurrection of Jesus and the modem person treats the dis¬ 
covery and confession of the risen Lord, the existential witness of the Easter accounts, allowing 
oneself to be taken into the dying and rising of Christ, experiencing the power of Christ’s 
resurrection, recognizing Jesus Christ as the one who gives life, being ready to hear the Easter 
message, and the encounter that makes us into new people. Pannenberg’s essay considers the 
resurrection of Jesus and the future of humanity from a theological perspective.

Mainz: Kohlhammer, 1981, paper DM 18) 156 pp. ISBN: 3-17-002015-3. 

After a 36-page treatment of the Law in the OT and a 13-page discussion of its place in 
Judaism, this volume considers the NT evidence: Jesus’ understanding of the Law, the Chris¬ 
tian affirmation of the Law (Jewish Christianity, Mt), various negative responses to the Law 
(the Stephen-circle, Paul, Hebrews, Markan traditions, Jn), and the period after the stmggle 
with Judaism (post-Pauline letters, Lk-Acts, faith as law). Smend, professor of OT at Gottingen, 
and Luz, professor of NT at Bern, point to a stmctural analogy in the Bible between Law and 
grace.

This investigation of the origin of the “theology of the poor’’ in the NT first considers how the 
poor are described. Then it discusses Jesus’ good news for the poor with reference to social 
conditions in Palestine and the Roman empire. The third chapter reflects on the theme “the 
gospel of the poor and we rich Christians.’’ Stegemann is also the author (with L. Schottroff) of 
Jesus von Nazareth—Hoffnung der Armen (1978).

raphy. Indexed. LCN: 80-5597. ISBN: 0-8191-1655-6 (cloth), 0-8191-1656-4 (paper). 

The slightly revised version of a doctoral dissertation directed by B. Reicke and accepted in 
1977 by the theological faculty at the University of Basel, this examination of the relationship 
between the Holy Spirit and the sufferings of early Christians contains chapters on the OT and 
intertestamental literature, the NT (Synoptic Gospels, Fourth Gospel, Acts, Paul’s epistles, 
1 Peter, Hebrews, 1 John, Revelation), the letters of Ignatius, Martyrdom of Polycarp, the letter 
of the martyrs of Lyons and Vienne (Hist. eccl. 5.1-2), Passion of Perpetua and Felicitas, and 
Tertullian’s writings. Weinrich concludes that in earliest Christianity the Spirit was understood 
as the agency either of Jesus’ victorious reign over death or of Jesus’ victory in the cross, that

F. Young, Can These Dry Bones Live? (London: SCM, 1982, paper £2.95) x and 114 pp. ISBN: 
0-334-01912-5. 

After expressing her conviction that a rediscovery of what it means to study the Bible and 
think theologically is essential for healthy life in the church, the author provides a specimen 
study on the meaning of atonement: the problems connected with the traditional answers to the 
problem of evil, the relation of the atonement to the redemption of all creation, apocalyptic 
thinking as the context for understanding the biblical materials about atonement, and the task of 
appropriating biblical and theological teaching today. Young is lecturer in NT studies at 
Birmingham University (UK).

Charles, 1979, $21.50) 248 pp., 8 plates, 4 maps. Indexed. ISBN: 0-7153-7680-2. 

This investigation of the relationship between the Dead Sea scrolls and the early church seeks 
to illuminate the genius of Jewish sectarianism and its culmination in a no less “heretical” form 
of Christianity. The fifteen chapters deal with the Essene library, the Lion of Wrath, Secacah in 
Galilee, the Dead Sea valley as a place of judgment and hell-fire, Joshua the son of Nun and the 
Teacher of Righteousness, the transition from mortal teacher to immortal Christ, the celibate 
ideal, the love feast, the “noble lie” of mythology. Tyre the once proud city, Helen the harlot of 
Tyre and light of the world, the dayspring from on high, the real Jesus, “and on this 
Rock . . . ,” and knowledge of self. The appendix provides a transcription, translation, and 
notes for 4QTherapeia. Allegro is also the author of Qumran Cave 4, I (4Q158^Q186) (1968).

965-223-352-8. 

Based on lecture notes left by Professor Alon (1901-50) and published in Modem Hebrew in 
1967, this volume first defines the talmudic age and reviews Jewish history in Palestine from 
A.D. 70 to 640. Then it examines the process of reconstmction after A.D. 70: the impact of the 
great defeat, Judea under Roman occupation, the postwar leadership of Yohanan ben Zakkai 
and Gamaliel of Yavneh, the land of Israel between A.D. 70 and 132, some aspects of the 
economy, the local government of Jewish towns, the original Sanhedrin, the revived Sanhedrin, 
measures adopted at Yavneh, the parting of the ways with Jewish Christianity, and inner 
tensions between the patriarch and the Sanhedrin. The second volume will treat the military 
resistance to Rome in the 2nd century A.D. and the decline of the Jewish community in

After reviewing scholarship on the Greek novels since E. Rohde’s Der griechische Roman 
and seine Vorlaiifer (1876) and discussing the problems involved in appreciating these works as 
playful fiction, this volume presents chapters on new comic melodrama (Chariton), Plato 
eroticus (Achilles Tatius), sacerdotal strategy and virtuoso virginity (Heliodorus), sympathy 
and sophrosyne (Longus), possibilities (summaries and fragments), missed opportunities (the 
devotional fringe and Xenophon of Ephesus), Petronius, and Apuleius. Anderson concludes 
that the Greek novelists used their sophistication with a light and mischievous touch, and were 
less committed in their attitudes to sentimental love and religion than has usually been assumed.

The Ad Hoc Committee on Basic Research Tools undertook three tasks for the American 
Philological Association: (1) discovering what work on basic materials for research in classical 
studies is already under way, (2) recommending specific tools for which the need is most 
pressing in the next decade, and (3) assessing the basic directions that the creation of research 
tools should take in the future. The first part of this report presents the conclusions and 
recommendations of the committee, and the second part provides information about work in 
progress in fourteen areas (e.g. Greek language and literature, Greek and Latin epigraphy, 
papyrology, antiquity and Christianity, oriental languages).

Bengtson, author of Marcus Antonius (1977) and Die Flavier (1979), aims to present not only 
the facts of Augustus’ life but also a picture of the Augustan age. Aspects of the emperor’s life 
treated in this volume are his youth, military and political activities, family and friends, life¬ 
style and personality, direction of the Roman empire, dealings with the senate, and old age. 
There are also discussions of historical sources, the poetry and prose of the Augustan age, its

pp. 275-575, fig. Bibliographies. Indexed. ISBN: 3-579-03923-7. 

In his 23-page introduction to Jubilees, Berger treats the theology of the book, its textual 
tradition, related texts and traditions (especially the Qumran writings), the circle in which the 
book originated, its date, and its structure. Dating to the period between 167 and 140 B.C., 
Jubilees is the work of an anti-Hellenistic, priestly reform group closely related to the 
Hasideans and to what later became the Qumran community. The main part of the fascicle 
provides a new German translation of Jubilees along with outlines of chapters, textual notes, 
literary parallels, and other comments.

Sentences of Sextus is a collection of 451 sayings expressed in various forms, which was 
probably compiled in Egypt in the 2nd century A.D. This volume presents on facing pages the 
Greek text (with text-critical notes below) and a new English translation. Although the Greek 
text remains substantially the 1959 edition by H. Chadwick, the editors have suggested new 
readings and emendations for twenty-one sayings. In the textual apparatus, particular attention 
is given to the Nag Hammadi Coptic fragments, which are collated for the first time in this 
edition. Edwards and Wild, who teach at Marquette University in Milwaukee, WI, describe the 
content of the work and its textual tradition in a six-page introduction.

(1st century A.D.), this volume presents French translations (with brief notes below) of ser¬ 
mons by the two writers. The selections from Teles’ works treat such topics as appearing and 
being, self-sufficiency, exile, poverty and riches, pleasure as not the ultimate goal, circum¬ 
stances, and apatheia. Among the issues raised in the selected writings of Musonius are the 
education of young women, moral formation through work in the fields, the obligation to raise 
all children who have been bom, and obedience to parents.

This examination of Roman lease law in antiquity argues that the relation between law and 
society was far closer than most modem legal historians would have us believe. The six chap¬ 
ters consider upper-class apartment housing in Ostia and Rome, the social institutions of the 
Roman rental market, the jurists’ treatment of urban leasehold, the Roman law of urban lease¬ 
hold, recognition of interests in Roman lease law, and Roman jurispmdence as an instmment of 
social control. One appendix discusses a recently published eviction notice from Oxyrhynchus,

translated into Greek, the morphological adaptation of the Latin words into Greek, the phonet¬ 
ics of Koine Greek according to the official acts translated into Greek, the morphology of Koine 
Greek in the epigraphic documentation, and the syntax of the documents.

Gesche, author of Caesar (1976) and professor of ancient history at the University of Giessen, 
first traces Rome’s expansion as a world power during the period of the republic: the process of 
expansion; the ways and means of extending power; the motives, goals, and backgrounds of 
empire-building; and the effect and consequences of world conquest. Then she analyzes how 
the Roman empire became a world state: foundations of integration; stabilizing rather than 
increasing the empire as the precondition and presupposition of inner development; the six 
pillars of world organization (carefully ordered administration, a worldwide economy, civilizing 
association, social openness, religious tolerance, cultic veneration of rulers); and evaluation 
from an ancient perspective.

ISBN: 0-86554-014-4. 

Hinson, professor of church history at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, 
KY, investigates the contribution made by Christianity’s major institutional forms (catechu- 
menate and baptism, the Eucharist, disciplinary procedures. Scripture and creeds, apostolic 
ministry) to the winning of the Roman empire in the first several centuries A.D. His study is 
divided into four parts: ideology and strategy for mission, identity and mission, adaptation and 
mission, and enlistment. He concludes that its institutional forms contributed significantly to 
early Christianity’s success by fostering its sense of monotheistic exclusiveness and by attract¬ 
ing converts.

how the tractate’s late 2nd-century A.D. creator(s) intended the laws of tithes to be understood. 
The following general outline is proposed: conditions under which produce becomes subject to 
the law (1:1-4), procedures by which harvested produce is rendered liable to the removal of 
tithes (l:5-4:5a), and unmet conditions and incomplete procedures (4:5b-5:8).

The translation and revision of Liturgie Juive et Nouveau Testament [NTA 10, p. 151], this 
volume aims to demonstrate how ancient Jewish liturgy and the Aramaic translations of the OT 
connected with it constitute a capital source for illustrating the message of the NT. It considers 
Scripture and tradition, tradition and liturgy, Jewish liturgy and the NT, the character of the 
biblical translations, the importance of the Targums, and the Targums and the NT. In preparing 
this edition, Le Deaut has updated a number of points and has nuanced and even modified 
certain affirmations so as to remain abreast of the current state of targumic studies. The notes 
and bibliography have also been revised from that perspective.

Malina, professor of biblical studies at Creighton University in Omaha, NB, and author of 
The Palestinian Manna Tradition (1968), describes the people responsible for the NT as a group 
of “foreigners” from the Mediterranean world of the 1st century A.D. In order to understand 
the social context of these foreigners, he calls upon theoretical models developed by cultural 
anthropologists in explaining various segments of behavior. After discussing the relation 
between biblical study and cultural anthropology, he investigates honor and shame as pivotal 
values, individual and group in the understanding of personality [see § 24-238], the perception of 
limited good [see § 23-657], kinship and marriage, and ciean and unclean according to rules of 
purity.

English translation on facing pages, followed by philological notes and indexes of proper names, 
Greek loanwords, and Coptic words. Then a grammatical analysis of the Coptic text discusses 
the nonverbal elements, the verbal system, certain scribal techniques, and dialectical variants. 
The subsequent 98-page exposition of the text examines the literary structure of the whole 
document and its parts, the interpretation of difficult terms and ideas, the parallels found in 
other Nag Hammadi documents, the history of traditions (especially with reference to the NT), 
and the document’s significance for the community for which it was composed. Meyer, who 
prepared this study as a doctoral dissertation under the direction of J. M. Robinson at 
Claremont Graduate School in Claremont, CA, concludes that the Greek original of Letter of 
Peter to Philip was written in the late 2nd or early 3rd century A.D. by a Christian gnostic who 
used Lukan and other early Christian motifs in setting forth Christian-gnostic perspectives on 
the fall into deficiency, the attainment of fullness, and the imprisonment and struggle of gnostics 
in the world.

and languages in the world of the Bible (J. C. de Moor, J. Hoftijzer, G. Mussies), the textual 
evidence and textual history of the OT and the NT (E. Tov, J. Smit Sibinga), the history of the 
ancient Near East (K. R. Veenhof, M, A. Beek), and biblical institutions (K. Roubos). The 
volumes on the OT and the NT are in preparation. The chief editor of the handbook is A. S. van

Reports, 1981, paper £10) viii and 183 pp., 39 plates. ISBN: 0-96043-118-5. 

This monograph attempts to demonstrate that (1) there was a link in form and content 
between some of the earliest images of Christian art and the eschatological thought of the 
contemporary pagan world, and (2) the Christian images represent a reinterpretation of some of 
these ideas as a result of the doctrine of rebirth into Christ, the spiritual regeneration achieved 
through baptism, and incorporation into the Christian community. After surveying the problems 
connected with the study of early Christian monuments and exploring the relation between 
literary texts and visual representations, the author focuses on three types of images: a single 
figure completely derived in form from pagan art (Orpheus), a set of images from one monu¬ 
ment that exhibits a mixed iconography (Tomb M in the Vatican necropolis), and a purely 
biblical symbol (Noah).

The fourteen essays in this volume concern theory and practice in public programs in the 
humanities (six articles), humanistic approaches to teaching about Judaism (three), humanistic 
approaches to the study of Judaism (four), and Judaic studies as the humanities of the Jewish 
heritage (one). The four articles most pertinent to the NT world treat the theory of comparison 
in the history of religions; the problems posed by the categories “Judaism,” “Christianity,” 
and “Hellenism”; the present state of rabbinic biography; and religion and society in ancient 
Judaism, with special reference to the 2nd and 3rd centuries A.D.

Press, 1981, $25) xix and 419 pp. Bibliography. Indexed. LCN: 80-26080. ISBN: 0-226-57617-5. 

The natural successor to the author’s forty-three volume history of mishnaic law, this book 
aims to describe the formation, earliest social context, and intellectual history of the kind of 
Judaism represented in the Mishnah. After a methodological introduction, it discusses the 
problems facing Jews in the 1st and 2nd centuries A.D. and the various responses to them. Then 
it discusses the state of Jewish law and the ideas embodied in it before A.D. 70, between the two 
wars against Rome, and from ca. A.D. 140 to 200. Finally, it interprets the history of the law in 
the social and intellectual context of the three periods of its unfolding. The five appendixes 
concern the Division of Agriculture before the wars. Scripture and tradition in Judaism, story 
and tradition in Judaism, important scriptural verses in the Mishnah, and a topical outline of the 
entire Mishnah. Neusner concludes that the evidence of the Mishnah points to a Judaism 
“defiant of the human condition of Israel, triumphant over the circumstance of subjugation and 
humiliation, thus surpassing all reality. All of this is to be through the act of Israel’s own mind 
and heart.”

accurate and usable picture of the Holy Land, the work done by previous generations of 
cartographers should not be ignored.

LCN: 81-2764. ISBN: 0-89130-488-6. 

Prepared as a doctoral dissertation under the direction of J. Neusner and accepted by Brown 
University, this analysis of tractate Terumot (“heave offering”) in the Mishnah and Tosefta 
seeks to uncover an aspect of the world view of rabbinic Judaism by providing a fresh transla¬ 
tion and a detailed commentary. The exegetical study aims to discern how those who produced 
the tractate in late 2nd-century A.D. Palestine understood the law of heave offering. Three 
major sections are distinguished in the tractate: how the heave offering is designated and 
separated (1:1-4:6), the proper handling of the heave offering that has been separated (4:7- 
10:12), and the preparation and use of the heave offering by the priest (11:1-10).

on facing pages the Coptic text of Apocalypse of Elijah according to P. Chester Beatty 2018 
(with an extensive text-critical apparatus below) and a new English translation. Also included 
are reduced photographs of the manuscript, an appendix on the Greek Apocalypse of Elijah, 
and indexes of Greek and Coptic words. Apart from furnishing an impressive array of variant 
readings, P. Chester Beatty 2018 provides thirty-four lines of text that were hitherto unknown.

and 165 pp. Bibliography. ISBN: 90-04-05918-0. 

This volume completes the collection, translation, and analysis of pericopes in rabbinic texts 
that are attributed to or concerned with Rabbi Ishmael. The first two volumes [NTA 22, pp. 
354-355] dealt with the nonexegetical and exegetical traditions in the tannaitic collections, 
respectively. This third volume investigates the exegetical comments attributed to Rabbi 
Ishmael in the gemarah of the Babylonian and Palestinian Talmuds and in Genesis Rabbah and 
Leviticus Rabbah. For each text, Porton attempts to ascertain the exact meaning, the exegetical 
techniques employed, the interrelation of the various exegetical comments, and the literary 
structure of the passage as a whole. The fourth volume will synthesize the traditions attributed 
to Rabbi Ishmael, describe their style and content, and analyze the importance of this sage as he 
is depicted in Jewish literature of late antiquity.

The revised and updated version of a study first published in Modem Hebrew as H'lyh Irgl 
by my hbyt hsny (1965), this volume first considers the place of the Second Temple in the life of 
the Jewish people and then explores the theme of pilgrimage under the following headings: 
pilgrimage as a biblical command; pilgrimage from within Israel and from the Diaspora; the 
pilgrims to the house of the Lord; ways to Zion; the pilgrims in Jemsalem; the pilgrims at the 
three pilgrimage feasts in Jemsalem; and the priestly and levitical divisions, the wood offering, 
and the first fruits. The five appendixes treat Philo and the halakah, the acceptance of offerings 
from Gentiles, whether Herod rebuilt the Samaritan temple, the order of the Passover meal, and 
the question of the wood offering. Safrai is also the author of Das jiidische Volk im Zeitalter des 
Zweiten Tempels (1978).

Schafer, the author of Studien zur Geschichte und Theologie des rabbinischen Judentums 
(1978), presents a rigorous and “atomistic” source-critical analysis of the literary materials 
used by modem historians to reconstmct the Bar Kokhba revolt (A.D. 132-135). The major 
topics dealt with in these sources are the chronology of the uprising, its causes. Bar Kokhba as 
its leader, the reconquest of Jemsalem and rebuilding of the Temple, the geographical extent of 
the revolt, the Bethar complex in rabbinic literature, the so-called Hadrianic persecution, and 
the positive view of Hadrian in rabbinic literature. Critical examination of the sources raises 
questions about the historical value of the rabbinic writings, and suggests that most modem 
treatments of the Bar Kokhba revolt are not solidly grounded.

so-called esoteric literature of rabbinic Judaism will be followed by a concordance of the textual 
corpus, a translation, and literary and redactional analyses.

After summarizing the content of 4 Ezra, Schreiner discusses its extant versions and original 
language, structure and sources, date of composition (ca. A.D. 100), and theological outlook. 
The main part of the fascicle consists of a new German translation of the work along with notes 
on textual problems, parallels, etc. The writer of 4 Ezra is said to have belonged to the “pious,” 
who sought to overcome the problems of their time with apocalyptic concepts that expressed 
their hopes for the coming reign of God.

Sixty years after the last substantial revision of Strack’s guide to rabbinic literature, 
Stemberger has produced a completely new version (though in some sections Strack’s words 
have been preserved). The goal is to do for our time what Strack did for his time. The three parts 
of the book concern the rabbinic writings in general (historical framework, the rabbinic educa¬ 
tional system, rabbinic hermeneutics, etc.), the talmudic literature (Mishnah, Tosefta, Pales¬ 
tinian Talmud, Babylonian Talmud, extracanonical tractates), and the Midrashim (halakic, 
expository, homiletic, etc.). Stemberger, professor of Jewish studies at the University of 
Vienna, is also the author of Geschichte der judischen Literatur (1977) and Das klassische 
Judentum (1979).

The first volume in this new edition of Samaritan Targum of the Pentateuch was described in 
NT A 25, p. 323. In this volume the juxtaposition of manuscripts J and A is continued until 
Numbers 29. Then since the two manuscripts are almost identical from Numbers 30 onward, J is 
presented on both rectos and versos with the variant readings in A noted in the upper apparatus. 
The readings in A have also been used to fill in gaps in J. The material from Deut 29:17 to 34:12 
has been reproduced from H. Petermann’s edition.

The first part of this volume (pp. 1-118) provides a bibliography of books and articles on 
Greek manuscripts arranged according to the alphabetical order of the names of the modem 
scholars who wrote them. The second part (pp. 119-625) is an index of Greek manuscripts, i.e. 
of handwritten materials in Greek script that are literary in content and have been preserved 
through medieval and modem libraries. The manuscripts are listed according to the alphabetical 
order of their present locations (city, institution) and their inventory numbers. A system of 
cross-references links together the two parts of the volume. The information is intended to help 
paleographers, codicologists, classical philologists, biblical scholars, patristic and Byzantine 
specialists, art historians, and others.
